	abstract = {The growing complexity of green transport vessels results in a gap between current ship design methods and new green transport vessel design. Innovative technologies such as digital twins (DTs) show the potential in supporting future complex designs when combined with suitable current ship design methods. The current state-of-the-art in DT-enabled design processes is still in its early research phases, both in the maritime world, and general engineering community. The most recent literature is presented, as well the role of optimization in the early design phases. Two complimentary design approaches are proposed, aimed at the concept design phases of green ships, where most of the design requirements are set (via design requirements) and locked-in (via initial design decisions). First, a DT-based green transport vessel design method is proposed which is then evaluated through a case study on an LNGpowered handysize bulk carrier. Four design scenarios are presented to show the ability of the design approach to simulate vessel behaviour, providing a feasible design space, and supporting early design decision-making. Second, an optimization-based DT design approach is proposed also covering the early concept design phase. Combined, the two complimentary DT design approaches help address the gap in enabling DTs in the design of green transport vessels.},

@phdthesis{streng_alternative_2021,
	title = {Alternative {Energy} {Carriers} in {Naval} {Vessels}},
	abstract = {Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have been at the forefront of both public and academic
debate for some years. Although the shipping industry has managed to remain relatively free of cli mate regulation this is changing with the IMO goals for 2050. The military sector has also escaped
scrutiny on sustainability issues. But this is also changing as the Dutch Ministry of Defence expressed
the ambition to reduce its carbon footprint, with the eventual goal to reduce the operational depen dency on a scarce resource, and to comply with national and international regulation. The direct aim,
therefore, is to reduce the fossil fuel consumption by 70\%, and to comply with IMO regulations by 2050.
In this thesis the possibilities for reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions will
be examined. This will be done for the seagoing large surface vessels of the Royal Netherlands Navy
by using alternative fuels. The main research question which will be answered in this thesis is the
following:
How are the design and the operational effectiveness of Royal Netherlands Navy vessels
affected by the use of alternative energy carriers and energy conversion technologies that
are needed to reduce the fossil fuel consumption of the Netherlands armed forces?
This question is answered through the execution of two case studies of vessels with different mission
profiles: the Zeven Provinciën class Air Defence and Command Frigate and the Landing Platform Dock
Johan de Witt. For both vessels, a design process is carried out in which more detail is progressively
added whilst down selecting the most suitable technologies.
The first step in the design process is an operational analysis. This operational analysis uses the
perceived missions profiles and the RNLN maritime doctrine to make a prioritization in a set of technical
properties or measures of effectiveness.
In the second design step, a systematic design variation is used to estimate the effect that different
energy carriers have on the main dimensions of the vessel. The parametric design tool developed for
this is an adapted version of the SPEC tool developed by Marin. The model estimates the required
power and the weight of different weight groups of the vessel.
The final design step continues with a more detailed proposal for a power plant configuration for
both case studies. With this detailed design a final assessment of the fuel consumption, exhaust gas
emissions, and operational effectiveness is made.
Throughout the design phases it was established that the displacement of both vessels would increase
significantly due to the lower energy density of the selected fuels. In the case of the Air Defence
and Command Frigate, the high top speed and relatively high fuel and system weight lead to a larger
increase in required fuel and installed power due to the increasing resistance when using anything
but the most energy­dense fuels. For the Landing Platform Dock, which has a more modest power
requirement and a relatively low system and fuel weight, the increase in displacement is smaller.
The use of fuel cells was also examined. For the Landing Platform Dock, there was an optimum
load share of the fuel cell where the increase of system weight and the reduction of the fuel weight
due to an increased efficiency were balanced. For the Air Defence and Command Frigate, no such
optimum was found. The low power density of the fuel cells significantly increased the system weight,
resistance, and thus the displacement.
In both case studies, the fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions were reduced
significantly. Due to the option to operate on only fuel cells, the vessels are also IMO tier III compliant.
The change in operational effectiveness was also dependent on the mission profile of the vessels.
The operational effectiveness of the frigate improved due to a significant reduction in acoustic signa tures. For the Landing Platform Dock, the design is mostly driven by the payload carrying capacity
which is negatively affected by the choice of energy carrier and energy converter.
iv
In conclusion, it can be said that the goals stipulated by the Ministry of Defence are attainable. The
effect on the operational effectiveness varies between vessels but the overall fuel consumption, cost,
and displacement are sure to increase significantly},

This article demonstrates that when controllability is emphasized during indicator development, the level of task uncertainty inﬂuences the type of resulting performance indicators. We report ﬁndings from a ﬁeld study in a medical rehabilitation centre in The Netherlands, where four low task uncertain teams (‘hand trauma’, ‘heart failure’, ‘amputation’, ‘chronic pain’), and four high task uncertain teams (‘children with developmental coordination disorders (DCD)’, ‘parkinson’s disease’, ‘young children (0–4 years) with developmental disorders’, and ‘acquired brain injuries’) participated in the development of performance indicators using the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System (ProMES) method. Results show that teams higher on task uncertainty developed relatively more process indicators compared to outcome indicators, whereas the reverse was true for teams lower on task uncertainty. Additionally, process indicators developed by high task uncertain teams were more of a problem solving nature than process indicators developed by low task uncertain teams, which had a more procedural character. The study expands existing knowledge by providing a framework which explicates the task processes to be executed under different levels of task uncertainty, and in line with that appropriate performance indicators for healthcare teams.},

Still, there is little knowledge of the uncertainties of KPIs. This article intends to shed some light on the uncertainty and reliability of KPIs in general and performance KPIs in particular. For this purpose, different uncertainty causes are discussed, and three data handling related uncertainty causes are analyzed in detail for ﬁve KPIs. A local sensitivity analysis is followed by a more detailed analysis of the related uncertainties. The work bases on different sets of operational data, which are manipulated in a large number of experiments to carry out an empirical uncertainty analysis. The results show that changes in the data resolution, data availability, as well as missing inputs, can cause considerable uncertainties. These uncertainties can be reduced or even mitigated by simple measures in many cases. This article provides a comprehensive list of statements and recommendations to estimate the relevance of data handling related KPI uncertainties in the day-to-day work as well as approaches to correct KPIs for systematic deviations and simple steps to avoid pitfalls.},

Uncertainty affects the lifecycle performance of a ship in a complex manner, which is difficult to assess in the early design process. We approach this problem by decomposing uncertainty into technical, commercial and operational aspects, and investigate how it can be identified, modelled and handled. Methods discussed include design structure matrix, tradespace exploration and evaluation methods, real options theory, stochastic optimization, and system dynamics. Strategies for handling uncertainty discussed include margins, and specific system lifecycle properties “-ilities”.

	abstract = {Mathematical formulations of reliability-based design and robust design have been developed for addressing the presence of uncertainty during optimization. When reliability is introduced in the design process, the constraints that are influenced by uncertainty are converted into probabilistic constraints. This ensures that the optimal solution will satisfy the constraints in the presence of uncertainty within a prescribed reliability level. Robustness is introduced by modifying the objective function to depend on the mean and variance of the response of the objective function. This paper presents a formulation for applying reliability-based design and robust design within a network of parallel optimizations in order to account for uncertainty in multidiscipline design optimization. The method for multidiscipline design optimization under uncertainty is applied to a conceptual ship design. The model of a bulk carrier from the literature is used in this analysis. The optimization results are compared with previous data and they demonstrate that reliable and robust optimization can be applied effectively to ship design, and that it is important to consider uncertainty during the multidiscipline ship design process.},

	abstract = {The paper presents an application of ship design optimisation subject to epistemic uncertainty. Generally, uncertainty that results from intrinsic variability (e.g. stochastic environmental or operating conditions) is termed aleatoric. Conversely, uncertainty is described as epistemic when it results from a lack of knowledge about a quantity whose true value (continuous or discrete) exhibits no actual variability (e.g. lack of information in the current stage of the design). Following a Bayesian approach, all the uncertainties are assigned a probability density function (PDF). Specifically, quantities with aleatoric uncertainty may be modelled as random variables through constructing their PDFs from observed data. Conversely, parameters with epistemic uncertainty may be assigned a PDF and the probability is inherently the degree of belief in a proposition. The present work addresses the epistemic uncertainty related to the location of the ship centre of gravity (CG), when optimising the hull form. Following a Bayesian approach, a probability density function (PDF) of the CG location is defined. Two complimentary formulations are presented and applied to the hull form optimisation.},

To this end, the efﬁcient processing of large amounts of data and the stochastic load combination by use of available numerical models may assist with the rationalisation of modelling assumptions and support the validation and veriﬁcation of design and decision making criteria in the context of risk based ship design.

In fact, autonomous cars tend to have an increasing ability to autonomously drive themselves, potentially reducing accidents and traffic congestion considering also the improvement of comfort, safety, and performance. This article presents a discussion over the instrumentation and classification of the autonomous cars to motivate the interested community to deeply understand the field. The definitions of autonomous cars are introduced according to SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers) and NHTSA (U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), which order and classify the levels of autonomy of autonomous cars. For each level described by the SAE, it characterizes by more complex functions and capabilities, the higher the level of vehicle autonomy and the less dependence on human intervention. The sensors employed in autonomous cars go from since unidimensional sensors as radar up to the camera, scanner, and LIDAR. This demonstrates that the sensor fusion is an important and necessary aspect that provides a wide vision of the environment in which the car is inserted to taken decisions in accordance driveability conditions that desire to reach.},

The standard systems engineering processes based on MIL-STD-499 and now ANSI/EIA-632 have been extensively applied to the development of military and commercial products. While the designs of the naval ship combat system payloads have used systems engineering methods, the ship design, and development has traditionally applied processes that are unique and not included in the standard systems engineering activities. The development of many ship subsystems has followed an evolutionary approach that has not required many of the systems engineering process steps. This paper defines some of the unique challenges of applying the systems engineering process to the design and development of Navy ships. Some of the traditional naval architecture and ship design processes are presented and contrasted with the systems engineering standards. The challenges that required the amalgamation of these two cultures are discussed. Finally, processes and methods that provide an integrated approach are presented.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            This paper describes the concept of Open Systems Architecture (OSA) applied to Navy ships and the benefits that accrue. Open Systems Architecture involves the development of reference models and associated standard interfaces that can be supported by commercial industry. These interfaces open the ship to the latest commercial equipment and technologies and can provide upgradeability, flexibility, and interoperability throughout the life of the ship. While OSA benefits are well established for electronic and computer systems throughout commercial industry and the Navy, the use of OSA for the total ship, including structural, electrical, mechanical, and other shipboard system interfaces represents a new and unproven application. An Industry/Navy Integrated Process Team (IPT) for Total Ship Open Systems Architecture (TOSA) was formed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, to develop total ship open systems.
            The TOSA approach facilitates the exploitation of commercial and cooperative research and development (R\&D) efforts throughout a ship's life by developing a framework of Open System Architecture and standard interfaces. By publishing the framework, future R\&D can consider the available space and services that may constrain a specific function in the design of new elements.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to deal with the operation of ships by crew members in ship design processes. This is important because the efficiency and safety of ship operations ultimately depends on the ability of human operators to use the technological systems designed for them, no matter how well the technology might perform. The challenge is that there are limited ship design processes combining coherent coevolution of ship architecture and ship operation. I propose a framework that helps ship designers connect the operation of ships by human operators with the design of ships and ship systems.
            
              1. Introduction
              Analysis of the actual uses of ship systems by human operators can inform the design of ships and ship systems with the aim of making them safe and efficient to use. However, this analysis is challenging because human-centered design (HCD) methods are not common in ship design practice and research (Lützhöft 2004; Lundh et al. 2011; Lurås \& Mainsah 2013; Costa \& Lützhöft 2014; Abeysiriwardhane et al. 2015). This research explores how HCD methods can be introduced to the ship design process. In this article, I present a set of human-centered methods structured into a framework that connects the operation of ships by human operators with the design of ships and ship systems.
              Rothblum (2000) states that designers need to understand the tasks of the human operators during ship operations and use this understanding to create designs that are compatible with all the systems the ship users interact with. Research on ship accident statistics supports the importance of this claim and shows that most accidents are connected to errors by human operators in their use of and interaction with ship systems (Kataria et al. 2015; Praetorius et al. 2015). There are good reasons to suppose that, similar to safety, the efficiency of ship operations is also closely connected to how ship systems enable the human operators to perform their tasks efficiently.},

Defining the module concepts is a significant challenge that impacts the effectiveness of the modularity solution. In this paper, we propose a functional synthesis method to design a set of modules comprising a modular ground vehicle fleet according to overall fleet-level objectives. We start with a functional decomposition of a baseline conventional fleet capable of performing a given fleet mission. We then formulate a functional synthesis problem to draw the boundaries that define modules for a modular fleet having the same mission capability with maximum fleet performance defined by average weight of the fleet performing the required operations and personnel time to reconfigure and maintain the fleet. An example problem is included to illustrate the approach. Results show a trade-off between two fleet-level objectives with respect to the degree of modularity.},

Two sample bottles, each one liter in volume, can be filled, either at pre-programmed sampling stations or manually, using the remote control. A trimaran design provides buoyancy and stability, with hulls constructed of vacuum-formed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic.

	abstract = {Autonomous vessels have emerged as a prominent and accepted solution, particularly in the naval defence sector. However, achieving full autonomy for marine vessels demands the development of robust and reliable control and guidance systems that can handle various encounters with manned and unmanned vessels while operating effectively under diverse weather and sea conditions. A significant challenge in this pursuit is ensuring the autonomous vessels’ compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). These regulations present a formidable hurdle for the human-level understanding by autonomous systems as they were originally designed from common navigation practices created since the mid-19th century. Their ambiguous language assumes experienced sailors’ interpretation and execution, and therefore demands a high-level (cognitive) understanding of language and agent intentions. These capabilities surpass the current state-of-the-art in intelligent systems. This position paper highlights the critical requirements for a trustworthy control and guidance system, exploring the complexity of adapting COLREGs for safe vessel-on-vessel encounters considering autonomous maritime technology competing and/or cooperating with manned vessels.},

Despite the fact that computer vision for object perception is undergoing an extraordinary evolution, single-vehicle systems’ constrained receptive ﬁelds and inherent physical occlusion make it difﬁcult for state-of-the-art perception techniques to cope with complex real-world trafﬁc settings. Collaborative perception (CP) based on various geographically separated perception nodes was developed to break the perception bottleneck for driving automation. CP leverages vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication to enable vehicles and infrastructure to combine and share information to comprehend the surrounding environment beyond the line of sight and ﬁeld of view to enhance perception accuracy, lower latency, and remove perception blind spots. In this article, we highlight the need for an evolved version of the collaborative perception that should address the challenges hindering the realization of level 5 AD use cases by comprehensively studying the transition from classical perception to collaborative perception. In particular, we discuss and review perception creation at two different levels: vehicle and infrastructure. Furthermore, we also study the communication technologies and three different collaborative perception message-sharing models, their comparison analyzing the trade-off between the accuracy of the transmitted data and the communication bandwidth used for data transmission, and the challenges therein. Finally, we discuss a range of crucial challenges and future directions of collaborative perception that need to be addressed before a higher level of autonomy hits the roads.},

	abstract = {The design of a complex warship is a multidisciplinary effort which often encounters major challenges, particularly with respect to integration across interfaces in the System of Systems (SoS). In principle, the goal of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with respect to system design is to provide a means of capturing and communicating the system design in a structured, consistent, and coherent fashion; that can be easily assessed by engineering teams and quickly analysed using queries and toolsets. The focus of this paper is to investigate the potential to achieve a consistent description, identify a viable methodology that minimises mismatch in requirements and to avoid an extended design lifecycle. This study highlights the need to develop a generic Architectural Description (AD) that is based on a common ontology which would clearly define the fundamental tenets of applying stateof-the-art Architectural Frameworks (AFs) in naval ship design. An investigation on the effectiveness and accuracy of a graphbased approach is needed to assess whether it is possible to create a ‘Rosetta stone’ for AFs, which links any two or more different model viewpoints in different AF’s using the approach.},

Based on the development of naval ship concept design model history, the three features of development process are further summarized. The first is that model-based system engineering (MBSE) becomes the basic of naval ship concept design, while the second one is that the multi-discipline crossing and combination becomes a general innovation model. And the third one is that systematization oriented naval system integration is the developing goal. Some detailed examples are presented to illustrate these three characteristics. Finally, the technology difficulties in naval ship concept design are also presented.},

	abstract = {Recently, researchers have shown a soaring interest in maritime autonomous surface ship (MASS). The reliable design and risk evaluation of MASS is crucial in order to support its safe operations. Hence, keeping abreast of emerging trends in developing MASSs safety and reliability-related technologies is necessary and significant. Nevertheless, a comprehensive literature review focused on this realm is currently lacking. On this premises, based on the 118 selected articles (consisting of 79 journal articles and 39 conference papers) between 2015 and 2022, content analyses and science mapping were conducted in this study from the aspects of journal sources, keywords, countries and institutions, authors, and citations of these publications. The bibliometric analysis aims to uncover several characteristics in this area such as the mainstream journals, research trends, knowledge contributors, and their cooperation relationships. Based on this, the research topic analysis was conducted from five facets including mechanical reliability and maintenance, software, hazard assessment, collision avoidance, communication and human element. It is suggested that the Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Function Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) could be two potential practical methods for future research risk and reliability analysis for MASS. This paper provides insights into the current state-of-the-art of risk and reliability research in MASS, including current research topics, gaps and future directions. It can also serve as a reference for related scholars.},

N o rank condition is imposed on E, so that the problem formulation encompasses (and is actually motivated by) the descriptor linear quadratic problem. The firstorder, necessary condition for optimality is derived from a variational argument that involves an ad hoc modification of the Bliss method, resulting in a Hamiltonian characterization in terms of Ex, rather than x, the former being smoother than the latter. This approach sidesteps the regularity conditions of the Lagrange multiplier theory. Under some mild assumptions, the necessary condition for optimality is also sufficient and the optimal control exists. The numerically relevant result is a generalized eigenvector, inverse-free characterization of optimality.},

These signs are called control directions since they represent effectively the direction of motion under any given control. Except for the unknown control directions, the class of systems satisfy the generalized matching conditions. Nonlinear robust control is designed to identify on-line unknown control directions and to guarantee global stability of uniform ultimate boundedness without the knowledge of nonlinear dynamics except their size bounding functions. It is also shown that the proposed robust control can be made continuous through utilizing the so-called shifting laws that change smoothly and accordingly the signs of robust controls and that, no matter what time constants and gains of the shifting laws are, global stability is always ensured. The analysis and design is done using Lyapunov’s direct method.},

In this paper we analysed and compared bootstrapping, proﬁle likelihood, Fisher information matrix, and multi-start based approaches for uncertainty analysis. The analysis was carried out on two models which contain structurally non-identiﬁable parameters. We showed that bootstrapping, multi-start optimisation, and Fisher information matrix based approaches yield misleading results for parameters which are structurally non-identiﬁable.

	abstract = {Naval ships are designed to operate in hostile environments. As such, vulnerability reduction is an important aspect that needs to be assessed during the design. With the increased interest in electrification and automation on board naval ships, the vulnerability of distributed systems has become a major topic of interest. However, assessing this is not trivial, especially in early stage design, where the level of detail is limited, but consequences of design decisions are large. As such, a new method for assessing the vulnerability of distributed systems in early stage design has been developed. This method not only evaluates the vulnerability of a pre-defined ship concept, but also provides direction for finding other, potentially better concept. This is done from the perspective of operational capabilities. The method helps ship designers and naval staff in setting vulnerability requirements, developing new concepts, and identifying trade-offs in operational capabilities. The method uses a discrete Markov chain and the eigenvalues of the associated transition matrix. A test case considering vulnerability of a notional Ocean-going Patrol Vessel (OPV) with two different powering concepts illustrates the method. Furthermore, the new method is discussed in terms of design knowledge, including a comparison with other early stage vulnerability reduction methods. In addition to that, an improvement of an existing early stage design procedure for distributed ship systems is made, which shows how the various methods, including the new method, are envisioned to be applied in practice.},

	abstract = {We propose an AI-assisted design concept exploration tool, the “Character Space Construction” (“CSC”). Concept designers explore and articulate the target product aesthetics and semantics in language, which is expressed using “Design Concept Phrases” (“DCPs”), that is, compound adjective phrases, and contrasting terms that convey what are not their target design concepts. Designers often utilize this dichotomy technique to communicate the nature of their aesthetic and semantic design concepts with stakeholders, especially in an early design development phase. The CSC assists this designers’ cognitive activity by constructing a “Character Space” (“CS”), which is a semantic quadrant system, in a structured manner. A CS created by designers with the assistance of the CSC enables them to discern and explain their design concepts in contrast with opposing terms. These terms in a CS are retrieved and combined in the CSC by using a knowledge graph. The CSC presents terms and phrases as lists of candidates to users from which users will choose in order to deﬁne the target design concept, which is then visualized in a CS. The participants in our experiment, who were in the “arts and design” profession, were given two conditions under which to create DCPs and explain them. One group created and explained the DCPs with the assistance of the proposed CSC, and the other did the same task without this assistance, given the freedom to use any publicly available web search tools instead. The result showed that the group assisted by the CSC indicated their tasks were supported signiﬁcantly better, especially in exploration, as measured by the Creativity Support Index (CSI).},

It counts support for policy formulation, budgeting, and the requirement formulation for new warships via concept exploration and concept definition studies, as well as costing, amongst its activities. To conduct these studies, the Maritime Systems Division invested in a set of early stage ship design tools to efficiently conduct concept exploration and concept definition studies that benefit from the set-based design methodology. The toolset includes ship synthesis tools, performance prediction tools, costing models, operational models and data-visualisation. The purpose of these tools twofold. First, to conduct an integral exploration of a wide range of alternative warship concepts to learn how requirements, ship design, effectiveness and cost interact, in order to identify desirable alternatives early on. Second, to define the most desirable alternatives in more detail to gain a better understanding of their performance, cost and risk. Several applications were conducted recently in support of the planned renewal of the Royal Netherlands Navy fleet. They included studies into motherships for unmanned mine-countermeasures systems, antisubmarine-frigates, diesel-electric submarines and a combat support ship.},

This was intended to follow on from van Griethuysen’s 2000 IMDC paper “Marine Design – Can Systems Engineering Cope?”, while drawing on the author’s recent experience in, firstly, directing and then being the MoD Future Surface Combatant (FSC) IPT Team Leader in the concept phase for that programme, where the intentions of Smart Procurement were applied. Since leaving the MoD in 2000, the author’s academic endeavours, at UCL, have both refined the ideas in the 2003 paper and, through a diverse range of ship design studies, provided further substantial evidence in favour of that paper’s argument. The current paper was originally presented to the first Institution conference on systems engineering. This is a revised version in the light of the discussion at that conference on the applicability of systems engineering practice to initial ship design and presents the arguments of both papers to a wider audience. 
The current paper looks at the origins of the concept of Requirements Engineering, within systems engineering, when specifically applied to naval engineering acquisition practice. This is contrasted with consideration of the actual nature of the initial design of physically large and complex systems, typified by modern naval vessels. This is followed by drawing specific insights from a series of design studies undertaken by the UCL Design Research Centre, under the direction of the author. These diverse and wide ranging initial design studies can be seen as examples of the sophistication of Requirements Elucidation, exemplifying how systems engineering practice can be applied to the critical early stages of naval ship design. The paper concludes by looking at the characteristics of the initial or concept design process by seeing Requirements Elucidation, as the strategy to tackle the inherently “wicked problem” of determining what is really wanted of a naval vessel and what can be afforded.},

	abstract = {Architecture generation and evaluation are critical points in complex system design. Uncertainties concerning component characteristics and their impact onto overall system performance are often not taken into account in early design stages. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian network (BN) approach for system architecture generation and evaluation. A method relying on Bayesian network templates is proposed in order to represent an architecture design problem integrating uncertainties concerning component characteristics and component compatibility. These templates aim at modeling designers' knowledge concerning system architecture. We also propose an algorithm for architecture generation and evaluation related to the Bayesian network model with the objective of generating all possible architectures and filtering them in view to a defined confidence threshold. Within this algorithm, expert estimations on component compatibilities are used to estimate overall architecture uncertainty as a confidence level. The proposed approach is tested and illustrated on a case study of bicycle design. This first case shows how uncertainties concerning component compatibilities and components characteristics impact bicycle architecture generation. The method is, additionally, tested and implemented in the case of a radar antenna cooling system design in industry. Results highlight the relevance of the proposed approach in view to the generated solutions as well as other benefits such as reduced time for architecture generation, and a better overall understanding of the design problem. However, some limitations have been observed and call for enhancements like integration of designer's preferences and identification of possible trade-offs within the architecture. This method enables generation and evaluation of complex system architecture taking into account initial system requirements and designer's knowledge. Its usability and added-value have been verified on a large-scale system implemented in industry.},

            The automation and intelligence highlighted in Industry 4.0 put forward higher requirements for reasonable trade-offs between humans and machines for decision-making governance. However, in the context of Industry 4.0, the vision of decision support for design engineering is still unclear. Additionally, the corresponding methods and system architectures are lacking to support the realization of value-chain-centric complex engineered systems design lifecycles. Hence, we identify decision support demands for complex engineered systems designs in the Industry 4.0 era, representing the integrated design problems at various stages of the product value chain. As a response, in this paper, the architecture of a Knowledge-Based Design Guidance System (KBDGS) for cloud-based decision support (CBDS) is presented that highlights the integrated management of complexity, uncertainty, and knowledge in designing decision workflows, as well as systematic design guidance to find satisfying solutions with the iterative process “formulation-refinement-exploration-improvement” (FREI). The KBDGS facilitates diverse multi-stakeholder collaborative decisions in end-to-end cloud services. Finally, two design case studies are conducted to illustrate the proposed work and the efficacy of the developed KBDGS. The contribution of this paper is to provide design guidance to facilitate knowledge discovery, capturing, and reuse in the context of decision-centric digital design, thus improving the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making, as well as the evolution of decision support in the field of design engineering for the age of Industry 4.0 innovation paradigm.},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/1853/50375},
	abstract = {Weight growth has been a significant factor in nearly every space and launch vehicle development program. In order to account for weight growth, program managers allocate a design margin. However, methods of estimating design margin are not well suited for the task of assigning a design margin for a novel concept. In order to address this problem, a hybrid method of estimating margin is developed. This hybrid method utilizes range estimating, a well-developed method for conducting a bottom-up weight analysis, and a new forecasting technique known as executable morphological analysis. Executable morphological analysis extends morphological analysis in order to extract quantitative information from the morphological field. Specifically, the morphological field is extended by adding attributes (probability and mass impact) to each condition. This extended morphological field is populated with alternate baseline options with corresponding probabilities of occurrence and impact. The overall impact of alternate baseline options can then be estimated by running a Monte Carlo analysis over the extended morphological field. This methodology was applied to two sample problems. First, the historical design changes of the Space Shuttle Orbiter were evaluated utilizing original mass estimates. Additionally, the FAST reference flight system F served as the basis for a complete sample problem; both range estimating and executable morphological analysis were performed utilizing the work breakdown structure created during the conceptual design of this vehicle.},

Specifically, this paper compares the combat SoS to an ecological network and develops a functional dependency network based effectiveness, resilience, and order-degree analysis method. Compared with the previous order-degree research, the proposed combat SoS architecture modeling and calcuation based on fucntional dependency network can reflect the rules of data exchanging more realistically. Based on the application to a notional anti-ship combat SoS, the orderdegree is able to reflect the relationship between SoS resilience index and cost-effectiveness index (CEI) in the given scenarios. This implies that the order-degree has a good opportunity to serve as an indicator for supporting balanced resilient SoS design.},

              Aircraft development is a protracted process over many years. Novel concept aircraft with new energy sources and disruptive systems technologies are investigated during the aircraft conceptual design phase with the goal to achieve sustainable aviation. Current development cycles need to be accelerated to reduce time to market and development costs of novel aircraft, while still handling complexity and uncertainty of systems technologies. Therefore, a holistic framework for knowledge‐based systems architecting using a model‐based systems engineering approach is presented. This framework has the purpose to conserve and provide knowledge, i.e., information, data, and experiences about existing systems architectures, to the engineer. The developed framework consists of a database concept, a method for model‐based systems architecting, and an interface to the overall systems design software tool

              MathWorks System Composer
              is selected as most suitable tool for knowledge‐based systems architecting. The developed framework is then demonstrated by conserving and reusing formalized knowledge for the design of a novel hydrogen‐powered concept aircraft. On‐board systems architecture models are saved in a database and automatically recreated reducing development time. The complete graphical representation could not yet be stored in a formalized manner partly reducing the advantage of a clear representation of model‐based systems architecting. However, this did not reduce automatic recreation and evaluation capabilities.},

	abstract = {The aircraft assembly system is highly complex involving different stakeholders from multiple domains. The design of such a system requires comprehensive consideration of various industrial scenarios aiming to optimize key performance indicators. Traditional design methods heavily rely on domain expert knowledge using documents to define assembly solutions which are later verified through simulations. However, these document-centric approaches cannot provide graphical notations for engineers to efficiently understand the entire assembly process. Moreover, it is difficult to analyze the performance of the designed assembly processes using simulations since the simulation models have to be developed based on the documents manually rather than be generated automatically from the design models. In this paper, a semantic-driven approach is proposed to support aircraft assembly process formalism and performance analysis. First, meta-models of aircraft assembly processes are developed based on SysML and discrete-event simulation models using a semantic modeling language named KARMA. Then an application ontology is defined for generating semantic models from KARMA architecture models to capture domain knowledge, system requirements and simulation model information of the aircraft assembly process. A model transformer is developed to transform the KARMA models to discrete-event simulation models based on the application ontology. Then the generated simulation models are executed to obtain the simulation results for verifying the designed assembly process. Finally, the obtained simulation results are used to support decision-making of selecting the optimal aircraft assembly process. A case study is conducted to verify the proposed method.},

Domain experts’ knowledge and the motivations for decision-making is a crucial asset for enterprises which is challenging to be captured and capitalised. Ontology-based Engineering (OBE) systems emerge as a new generation of Knowledge-based Engineering techniques with advancements of ontology engineering methods and computer science technologies. Ontologies enable to capture both explicit and implicit domain knowledge from historical records and domain experts. These Ontology-based Engineering systems can stand highly complex collaborative design processes involving multidisciplinary stakeholders and various digital tools. This paper proposes a tradespace framework with Ontology-based Engineering features included on top of existing Model-Based System Engineering and interoperability capabilities. These additional Ontology-based Engineering features reuse formalised knowledge via knowledge graph technologies and generative algorithms, changing the cognitive process from the designer, to an automatic process which generates design alternatives for the designer. The tradespace framework is demonstrated in a case study to design the aircraft fuselage orbital joint process, helping the designer to take better strategic decisions at conceptual phase and proving to be an advantageous paradigm for the design process.},

This paper proposes a novel approach of performing functional based DSMs. This approach aligns closely with several Architecture Development Methods (ADMs) and serves as a great way to both manually perform and to teach the architectural derivation of a system. An advantage of using the functional DSM method is that system modularity can easily be identified, which aligns with the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) modular design tenets. This paper will demonstrate how the functional DSM method can be used to define the architecture of a Software Defined Radio (SDR) based system, for both a large and small platform. Further, it will be demonstrated how the DSM findings can also be combined with the MOSA Key Open Subsystem (KOSS) tool to further enhance modularity and ensure low cost growth and capability insertion over the entire system lifecycle. The author’s intent is to not imply that the detailed DSM approach replaces model based architecting. On the contrary, there are model based architectural derivation methodologies (e.g. Arcadia Capella) that have rich artifacts to support all steps of the architecture derivation process. However, this approach provides a means to synthesize a robust modular architecture without model based techniques and allows practitioners to gain a better understand the architectural development elements before a pure modeling approach is used.},

In this methodology, the related knowledge is captured in a well-structured Systems Modeling Language (SysML) model, instead of (static) documents. The knowledge model is then automatically translated to application (skeleton) code using a model-to-code tool developed in this research. The proposed methodology is applied to a use case at GKN Fokker Elmo for the development of a KBE application to design Electrical Wiring Interconnection Systems (EWIS) architectures for aircraft. The results show that the proposed MBSE approach improves the knowledge acquisition process, reduces the time needed for developing new KBE applications (initial knowledge model and code skeleton) by almost 50\%, and enables traceability of requirements within the KBE application and knowledge model. These benefits allow effective project-to-project knowledge transfer while mitigating the black-box effect often experienced by KBE application users. In the next phase of this research, reverse engineering capabilities will also be incorporated to enable code-to-model translation, so as to guarantee the application code and knowledge model synchronization throughout the application's lifetime.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for analyzing distributed ship systems. The increase in interconnected and interdependent systems aboard modern naval vessels has signiﬁcantly increased their complexity, making them more vulnerable to cascading failures and emergent behavior that arise only once the system is complete and in operation. There is a need for a systematic approach to describe and analyze distributed systems at the conceptual stage for naval vessels. Understanding the relationships between various aspects of these distributed systems is crucial for uninterrupted naval operations and vessel survivability. The framework introduced in this paper decomposes information about an individual system into three views: the physical, logical, and operational architectural representations. These representations describe the spatial and functional relationships of the system, together with their temporal behavior characteristics. This paper deﬁnes how these primary architectural representations are used to describe a system, the interrelations between the architectural blocks, and how those blocks ﬁt together. A list of deﬁned terms is presented, and a preliminary set of requirements for speciﬁc design tools to model these architectures is discussed. A practical application is introduced to illustrate how the framework can be used to describe the delivery of power to a high energy weapon.},

	abstract = {The process of systems engineering has always emphasized the definition of requirements as the first step toward product development. Typically, however, these requirements were examined in isolation from the potential systems and technologies they would likely impact. Further, requirements were treated deterministically during design, which sometimes led actual systems that were nonrobust when different requirements were encountered. Thus, there is a need to examine requirements early on and in a new way. This “new way” must include an environment for the simultaneous examination of requirements, design variables, and technologies. Further, this environment must be built in a probabilistic fashion since the requirements may be ambiguous and/or uncertain, the eventual cost and performance of critical technologies are highly uncertain, and the possibility of system “growth” must be accounted. The ultimate goal of the probabilistic approach is finding solutions robust to these uncertainties. A methodology for the creation of just such an environment is described in this paper. Subsequently, the implementation of the methodology is demonstrated through an example study of a notional, multi-role fighter aircraft.},

	title = {A {Framework} for {Vulnerability} {Reduction} in {Early} {Stage} {Design} of {Naval} {Ship} {Systems}},
	abstract = {Naval ships are designed to operate and survive in hostile environments. As such, vulnerability reduction is a major topic of interest during the design of a naval ship. For modern naval ships the vulnerability is largely determined by the design and layout of distributed systems. The vulnerability of these systems needs to be assessed early on, as design decisions made in this stage are decisive for the vulnerability of the final ship. Various early stage methods for assessing vulnerability exist, but a clear structure on when to use what types of methods, how these methods relate to each other, and how these methods provide relevant answers, is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework for early stage design of distributed systems, in the context of vulnerability reduction. This framework supports in choosing the right vulnerability method at the right design stage. The framework considers an operationally oriented systems perspective on vulnerability, and a physically oriented ship perspective. In addition to that, early stage design is subdivided in concept exploration and concept definition, which have different purposes and contributions in the design process. The framework provides examples of methods that can be used to investigate vulnerability for the various perspectives and design stages. These examples consider methods that have been developed by joint Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and the Netherlands Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) research efforts, as well as other methods. Opportunities and challenges for integrating these methods between themselves and in the design process in general are discussed.},

              This paper delves into the technical aspects and viability of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and knowledge-based engineering (KBE) tools in practical design. The goal is to digitally embed the hands-on expertise and technical boundaries set by seasoned professionals during intricate engineering and preparatory phases. We showcase how AI/KBE tools might emulate human cognitive processes to make well-informed choices. The article also probes the prospective economic and modernization repercussions of this innovation. Our findings suggest that such an integration is feasible and can amplify the decision-making efficacy and advance the sophistication of CAD/CAM systems in the shipbuilding realm. Furthermore, this investigation underscores the promising future of AI/KBE tools in ship design and advocates for continued exploration and innovation in this sector to fully harness its advantages.
            
            
              Introduction
              Shipbuilding has long been intertwined with CAD/CAM technologies. As technology evolves, so does the landscape of ship design and manufacturing (Ross, 1950). Traditionally, ship design leaned heavily on seasoned engineers and designers, whose insights were cultivated over years of experience. However, with the rising demand for ships and an aging workforce, there’s a pressing need for enhanced design methodologies. Enter the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and knowledge-based engineering (KBE), which promise to revolutionize ship design by integrating practical knowledge and technical constraints. In today’s shipbuilding scenario, younger engineers often handle detailed engineering stages, a shift from when experienced professionals dominated the shop floor (Moyst and Das, 2005). Our research aims to assess the feasibility of AI KBE systems in enhancing the ship design process during these stages, by virtualizing the knowledge of experienced workers.},

	abstract = {Ship design is a years-long process that requires balancing complex design trade-offs to create a ship that is efﬁcient and effective. Finding new ways to improve the ship design process could lead to signiﬁcant cost savings in the time and effort required to design a ship, as well as cost savings in the procurement and operation of a ship. One promising technology is generative artiﬁcial intelligence, which has been shown to reduce design cycle times and create novel, high-performing designs. In a literature review, generative artiﬁcial intelligence was shown to generate ship hulls; however, ship design is particularly difﬁcult, as the hull of a ship requires the consideration of many objectives. This paper presents a study on the generation of parametric ship hull designs using a parametric diffusion model that considers multiple objectives and constraints for hulls. This denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) generates the tabular parametric design vectors of a ship hull, which are then constructed into a point cloud and mesh for performance evaluation. In addition to a tabular DDPM, this paper details adding guidance to improve the quality of the generated parametric ship hull designs. By leveraging a classiﬁer to guide sample generation, the DDPM produced feasible parametric ship hulls that maintained the coverage of the initial training dataset of ship hulls with a 99.5\% rate, a 149× improvement over random sampling of the design vector parameters across the design space. Parametric ship hulls produced using performance guidance saw an average 91.4\% reduction in wave drag coefﬁcients and an average 47.9× relative increase in the total displaced volume of the hulls compared to the mean performance of the hulls in the training dataset. The use of a DDPM to generate parametric ship hulls can reduce design times by generating high-performing hull designs for future analysis. These generated hulls have low drag and high volume, which can reduce the cost of operating a ship and increase its potential to generate revenue.},

While interfaces in CPS systems might be generic, the data that is produced for custom application needs has to be transformed and merged in very specific ways, to allow systems engineers proper interpretation and insight-extraction. In order to enable efficient cooperation between systems engineers and data scientists, the systems engineers have to provide a fine-grained specification that (a) describes all parts of the CPS, (b) how they might interact, (c) what data is exchanged between them, and (d) how the data inter-relates. A data scientists can then iteratively (including further refinements of the specification) prepare the necessary custom machinelearning models and components. Therefore, this work introduces a method supporting the collaborative definition of machine learning tasks by leveraging model-based systems engineering in the formalization of the systems modeling language SysML. The method supports the identification and integration of various data sources, the required definition of semantic connections between data attributes and the definition of the data processing steps within the machine learning support. Integrating machine learning-specific properties in systems engineering techniques allows non-data scientists to define a machine learning problem, document knowledge on the data, and further supports data scientists to use the formalized knowledge as input for an implementation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Model‐based systems engineering (MBSE) is an increasingly accepted practice in the Systems Engineering (SE) community, however, little has been done to empirically show that MBSE provides value. Furthermore, as the industry continues in the direction of digital transformation, MBSE will become a critical component of the larger Digital Engineering (DE) approach. This paper presents a measurement framework for selecting and developing appropriate metrics to assess the value/benefits of MBSE and subsequently DE. Utilizing expected benefits identified in a review of MBSE literature, a causal map was hypothesized to show how expected benefits (potential metrics) influence and relate to each other. This was done in order to systematically determine which benefits would be the most impactful to measure. The hypothesized causal model was presented for feedback to subject‐matter experts from a working group developing the first DE measurement framework. This group is a joint effort with industry, academia, and the USA government to develop DE metric standards. Once the causal map was finalized, a case study was used to partially validate the causal model. Based on the causal map and subsequent analysis, we can recommend the first metrics to be employed for DE/MBSE based on the most influential nodes of the causal model. The potential metric candidates include: system quality, defects, time, rework, ease of making changes, system understanding, Effort, accessibility of information, collaboration, project methods/processes, and use of DE/MBSE tools. We believe a concerted effort across the industry to focus on measuring these variables is the most effective way to establish proof of the value of MBSE and DE.},

	abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have the characteristics of a high performance, a complex coupling mechanism, a compact, complex system composition, as well as high requirements for design constraints, quality, and reliability. In the traditional overall design process, numerous design tools and software programs are used, which results in poor model data sharing, a lack of uniqueness and synchronization between system levels, and difficulty in process tracing. Moreover, it is challenging to meet the technical requirements for close collaboration and rapid iteration of multiple positions. To address the aforementioned limitations, this study proposes a digital overall integrated design method for the design and simulation integration of AUVs and defines a unified architecture and interface for system-level design simulation models, thus solving the interoperability and consistency problems in multiple tools and models. In addition, a model-based AUV system integration design verification method that combines different processes, specifications, and models is designed, and software similar to Cameo, which can provide technical means for system-level integrated design and achieve rapid modeling and simulation verification based on system design solutions, is developed. Finally, a practical system design is conducted by taking specific AUV equipment as a research object, and the proposed methods are compared with traditional methods to prove the improvement effect of the technical route on the equipment and development efficiency.},

	abstract = {Functional analysis is the key transition from needs analysis, where new ideas and concepts are developed, to the functional analysis phase where the new system concept starts to be engineered. It has been seen that in keeping with the inherent magnitude of designing a complex system, the systems engineering method divides the design task into two steps: analyzing and formulating the functional design of the system and selecting the most advantageous implementation of the system functions. At the initial phase of the system development process, functional analysis is an extension of operational studies, directed to establishing whether there is a feasible technical approach to a system that could meet the operational objectives. Two important inputs to the functional allocation process are the predecessor system and functional building blocks. There are several products that systems engineers will use to describe the system's functions. They are: functional block diagram, functional flow diagram, and sequence diagrams.},

	abstract = {Abstract   The increasing of complexity of industrial products makes Verification and Validation procedures challenging. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been proposed as an approach to manage such complexity through the formalized application of models throughout the systems development life cycle to support verification activities.  The purpose of this paper is to make a first step towards developing a verification strategy by performing a qualitative survey on current industrial practices against the state of the art in MBSE.  Data had been collected through workshops of 16 engineering organizations located in the Rhone-Alpes region of France. Key success criteria for integrating model-based verification with MBSE are identified by industry respondent. These criteria allow to analyse the top verification methods presented in MBSE publications and compare them to current practices. To further validate the use of these presented methods, interviews and observations were conducted to analyse the methods through different industrial perspectives and identify their feasibility for successful application.  The findings of this study gives a picture of current practices in integrating verification and MBSE in industry. The paper discusses the impact of implementing such practices in companies beginning to adopt MBSE approaches. It is concluded by identifying opportunities and barriers for Model-Based Verification adoption.},

Requirements analysis is carried out by identifying stakeholders with the cycle modeling for this system and the use of case modeling to ensure that the requirements are comprehensive and correct. Additionally, the standard system requirements are obtained and baselined. Based on system requirements, the trade-off analysis of hierarchical functional architecture and key indicators was mainly carried out to design the logical architecture. Once the logical architecture was decided, the logical architecture was allocated to the physical architecture to be implemented. Several physical architectures are analyzed hierarchically to seek the optimal architectures. Then, other CAE analysis tools were integrated to verify the physical architecture design. All these processes are modeled and integrated as the authority system model, which benefits the system engineer for managing the requirement changes easier and rapidly provides multi-views for different roles.},

	abstract = {Abstract Systems engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary domain that can benefit from incorporating contributions from fields not typically associated with technical disciplines, including integrating relevant research from social sciences. The study of innovation has produced the diffusion of innovation theory, which identifies variables that affect the adoption rate of innovations. Of these variables, the perceived attributes of the innovation have been shown to have the most significant impact on the adoption rate of innovations. Shaping the innovation attributes of relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability and how they are perceived can accelerate its adoption rate. This theory has the potential to accelerate the adoption rate of SE innovations. Model‐based systems engineering (MBSE) is an SE innovation that, despite its benefits, has not been adopted generally. An evaluation of the attributes of MBSE as defined by the diffusion of innovation theory can aid in understanding its slow diffusion and inform methods to accelerate its adoption. Since there is some evidence to suggest that this theory is applicable to SE and MBSE, additional research should be conducted to determine the best way to utilize its principles.},

	abstract = {In order to allow Systems Engineers to utilize data produced in cyber-physical systems (CPS), they have to cooperate with data-scientists for custom data-extraction, data-preparation, and/or data-transformation mechanisms. While interfaces in CPS systems might be generic, the data that is produced for custom application needs has to be transformed and merged in very specific ways, to allow systems engineers proper interpretation and insight-extraction. In order to enable efficient cooperation between systems engineers and data scientists, the systems engineers have to provide a fine-grained specification that (a) describes all parts of the CPS, (b) how they might interact, (c) what data is exchanged between them, and (d) how the data inter-relates. A data scientists can then iteratively (including further refinements of the specification) prepare the necessary custom machine-learning models and components. Therefore, this work introduces a method supporting the collaborative definition of machine learning tasks by leveraging model-based systems engineering in the formalization of the systems modeling language SysML. The method supports the identification and integration of various data sources, the required definition of semantic connections between data attributes and the definition of the data processing steps within the machine learning support. Integrating machine learning-specific properties in systems engineering techniques allows non-data scientists to define a machine learning problem, document knowledge on the data, and further supports data scientists to use the formalized knowledge as input for an implementation.},

Both an MBSE approach and non-MBSE approach were applied to architecting an orbiting sample Capture and Orient Module (COM) system concept for a Capture, Containment, and Return System (CCRS) payload concept for Mars Sample Return (MSR). These approaches were applied in parallel to provide a side-by-side comparison of the approaches. The approaches were analyzed using design structure matrices (DSM) and evaluated based on the amount of information transferred between process tasks manually (e.g., elements physically typed into text boxes in a presentation slide) vs automatically (e.g., elements automatically filled out within a block in a model view due to explicitly defined element associations). A total of 4,819 information element transfers were traced in DSMs and used to quantitatively compare the two approaches. The non-MBSE approach required manual transfer for all 4,819 information elements. The MBSE approach required manual transfer for 4,189 information elements and automatic transfer for 630 information elements, providing a minor increase in the automation of information transfer relative to the non-MBSE approach. By incorporating the use of additional MBSE artifacts into the trade study and peer review tasks, manual transfer could potentially be reduced to 931 information elements, and automatic transfer increased to 3,888 information elements.},

Method: A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of the literature scoping tools for DSL development. Results: We identified 59 tools, including 9 under a commercial license and 41 with non-commercial licenses, and analyzed their features from 230 papers. Conclusion: There is a substantial amount of tools that cover a large number of features. Furthermore, we observed that usually, the developer adopts one type of notation to implement the DSL: textual or graphical.

The COM architecture was modeled, simulated, and evaluated against nominal load power and output data rate requirements to compare the two approaches. A new modeling and simulation‐centric V‐model was synthesized from existing V‐model and modeling and simulation process models to map out the modeling and simulation activities within the context of the system development lifecycle and used as a tool to compare the non‐MBSE and MBSE approaches. A three‐phase modeling and simulation process consisting of an analysis and modeling phase, computer programming and implementation phase, and experimentation phase was used to model and simulate the COM. The total number of manual and automatic knowledge processed was calculated for both approaches and used to quantify the benefits of the MBSE approach relative to the non‐MBSE approach. In the non‐MBSE approach, all knowledge elements were manually processed during the modeling and simulation process. In the MBSE approach, 49\% of total knowledge processing was automated. The MBSE approach showed user experience benefits with modeling and simulating the COM robotic space system through providing a higher level of support for automation, reducing the burden of systems engineering tasks, and reducing effort.},

In this paper, we aim to ease the process of implementation by investigating where the current issues with the existing systems engineering processes lie, and where a model-based approach may be able to help, from the perspective of engineers working on spacecraft functional avionics in Airbus. A repeatable process has been developed to elicit this information. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with 25 Airbus engineers working in Operations, Software and Failure, Detection, Isolation and Recovery. The acquired data has been thematically analysed to extract common themes from the responses.

However, the adequacy of this comparison is challenged upon a side-by-side examination of what MBSE and CAD are. Based on the established definitions, it is evident that while CAD can be considered a method of mechanical drawing, MBSE cannot be described as only a method. MBSE is more than installing and utilizing software, it is a process in and of itself. Comparing MBSE to CAD runs the risk of oversimplifying MBSE and setting up expectations that may not be met. Therefore, while CAD may represent a similar paradigm shift as MBSE in terms of digitalization, it may not serve as an adequate paradigm in terms of adoption and benefits. In this paper, we characterize and compare CAD and MBSE and identify the similarities and differences between them.

	title = {A {Model}-{Based} {Systems} {Engineering} {Framework} for developing {Knowledge} {Based} {Engineering} {Applications}},
	abstract = {Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) is a particularly relevant technology for addressing the increasing complexity of engineering systems, the need for rapid time-to-market, and the need for achieving reductions in the costs of product development. KBE applications can be effective means of automating repetitive engineering design tasks, enabling engineers to enhance their designs through optimization and innovation. However, the current development process of KBE applications can be improved, as it has shortcomings that limit a wider adoption of KBE technology. Currently, two primary approaches are employed in the development of KBE applications. The first approach involves directly coding the engineering knowledge within the application itself, while the second approach entails modeling the engineering knowledge outside the application and subsequently converting it into executable code, manually. Both approaches result in applications that are perceived, to varying degrees, as “black boxes”. This makes it challenging to understand how the application reaches its conclusions, which can hinder the end-user's trust in the application and limit its acceptance. To date, a suitable methodology to effectively support KBE app development is lacking, which has considerable implications on the time required for application development, as well as the quality of the applications in terms of traceability of requirements and domain knowledge within the KBE application code, the applications' maintainability and scalability, and (eventually) the ability to preserve and efficiently reuse engineering knowledge.
To address the outlined shortcomings of the current KBE app development process, this thesis proposes a novel framework for the development of KBE applications, based on Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) concepts, to model domain knowledge and requirements, and to support (semi-)automatic generation of KBE apps through visual editing, as opposed to standard coding. The key objectives of this framework are to improve knowledge capture and formalization, requirements traceability, and knowledge reuse in KBE applications. In the proposed framework, the knowledge required for developing a KBE application is first captured in a formal knowledge model that uses the industry-standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Source code is then automatically generated for the targeted KBE system (ParaPy) using a model-to-code tool developed in this research. Traceability of requirements onto the various elements of the KBE app architecture is also provided, thereby reducing the typical black-box effect of KBE applications. Furthermore, the framework allows to reuse knowledge from previously generated knowledge models, enabling effective project-to-project knowledge transfer.
This thesis presents the development of three distinct KBE applications using the proposed framework, with the aim of evaluating it in terms of ease of modeling, development time, and quality of the automatically generated (skeleton) code. Preliminary results show that the learning curve to modeling is intuitive and easy enough to learn; the time required for generating the knowledge models is lower than current modeling processes; the automatically generated code is error-free, well-structured, and complies with existing coding standards, providing a correct starting point for further app development, while resulting in time savings in the development of the app skeleton.},

	abstract = {In this article, a multilayer framework is proposed to assess the reliability of shore-to-ship charging (S2SC) systems, considering the potential for failures of the main elements, such as power converters and batteries. The proposed reliability model enables evaluating an S2SC system with redundancy, multistate system availability, and multivariable design scenarios based on a recursive algorithm. Instead of conventional Markov-chain multistate models, a reduced order state-space model is established from a set of speciﬁc subsystems with a predeﬁned conﬁguration complying with the design requirements. A modular approach is taken, and the probabilistic characteristics of the subsystems are established by developing a Universal Generating Function considering the available charging power and energy balance constraints. Then, the subsystems are integrated into the system conﬁguration to assess a set of proposed application-speciﬁc system-level reliability indices. Thus, the modular approach enables expansion to the power system dimensions without extra complexity. Finally, a case study based on an operating 4-MW dc S2SC system is performed by the proposed framework, and design suggestions are given based on a Figure of Merit (FoM) deﬁned for evaluation of reliability and energy efﬁciency. These design suggestions include resizing the charging system by installing onshore batteries, modularization, and introduction of redundancy in the subsystems.},

	abstract = {The digital twin technology platform has not yet, achieved the expected acceptance and wider implementation in the maritime industry, although theoretically, it makes a lot of sense in advancing vessels' life cycle control and performance monitoring. There could be many reasons behind such a reluctance to take new technology into full use. It is argued by this article, that too complex, too expensive, and too few goal-oriented real-life examples are some influential factors. The success rate of such technology development and implementation is therefore limited. Thus, the promised and expected shortand long-term benefits to be achieved from digital twin applications in relation to vessel operations and their design are still missing. It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to present and discuss some of the reasons for this lack of success.},

The reliable design and risk evaluation of MASS is crucial in order to support its safe operations. Hence, keeping abreast of emerging trends in developing MASSs safety and reliability-related technologies is necessary and significant. Nevertheless, a comprehensive literature review focused on this realm is currently lacking. On this premises, based on the 118 selected articles (consisting of 79 journal articles and 39 conference papers) between 2015 and 2022, content analyses and science mapping were conducted in this study from the aspects of journal sources, keywords, countries and institutions, authors, and citations of these publications. The bibliometric analysis aims to uncover several characteristics in this area such as the mainstream journals, research trends, knowledge contributors, and their cooperation relationships. Based on this, the research topic analysis was conducted from five facets including mechanical reliability and maintenance, software, hazard assessment, collision avoidance, communication and human element. It is suggested that the Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Function Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) could be two potential practical methods for future research risk and reliability analysis for MASS. This paper provides insights into the current state-of-the-art of risk and reli­ ability research in MASS, including current research topics, gaps and future directions. It can also serve as a reference for related scholars.},

Digital transformation is essential for businesses to remain competitive in the global marketplace. One of the effective tools for such a transformation is model-based systems engineering (MBSE). However, there is a gap in the practical application of knowledge regarding the uniform principles for the formation of a digital representation of complex technical systems, which limits the realization of the cross-industry potential of digital transformation in the economy. The motivation for this study is to identify common cross-industry principles for the formation of digital representations of complex technical systems that can lead companies to a sustainable and successful digital transformation. The purpose of this work is to identify and formulate these principles through an analysis of publications, using an inductive approach and classifying them by the category of application. As a result of the study, 23 principles were obtained, and the degree of their use in various industries associated with complex technical systems was determined. The results of this study will help to solve the problem of cross-industry integration and guide systemic changes in the organization of enterprises during their digital transformation.},

	abstract = {In the Systems Engineering (SE) domain there has been a paradigm shift from document-based to model-based system development artefacts; in fact, new methodologies are emerging to meet the increasing complexity of current systems and the corresponding growing need of digital workflows. In this regard, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is considered as a key enabler by many central players of the SE community. MBSE has reached an adequate level of maturity and there exist documented success stories in its adoption in industry. In particular, one significant benefit of utilising MBSE when compared to the traditional manual and document-centric workflows is that models are available from early phases of systems development; these enable a multitude of analyses prior any implementation effort together with other relevant capabilities, like the automation of development tasks. Nonetheless, it is noticeable there is a lack of a common understanding for how formal analyses for the verification and validation (V\&V) of systems behaviour, specifically in the early phases of development, could be placed in an MBSE setting.
            
              In this article, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic literature review regarding the early V\&V of systems behaviour in the context of model-based systems engineering. The review aims to provide a structured representation of the state-of-the-art with respect to motivations, proposed solutions, and limitations. From an initial set of potentially relevant 701 peer-reviewed publications we selected 149 primary studies, which we analysed according to a rigorous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. Based on our results, early V\&V has usually the goal of checking the quality of a system design to avoid discovering flaws when parts are being concretely realised; SysML is a
              de facto
              standard for describing the system under study, while the solutions for the analyses tend to be varied; also V\&V analyses tend to target varied properties with a slight predominance of functional concerns, and following the variation mentioned so far the proposed solutions are largely context specific; the proposed approaches are usually presented without explicit limitations, while when limitations are discussed, readiness of the solutions, handling of analyses simplifications/assumptions, and languages/tools integration are among the most frequently mentioned issues.
            
            Based on the survey results and the standard SE practices, we discuss how the current state-of-the-art MBSE supports early V\&V of systems behaviour with a special focus on industrial adoption, and identify relevant challenges to be researched further.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the integration of modelbased systems engineering (MBSE) and scenario-based engineering (SE) approaches in the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving (AD). The increasing complexity of automotive systems necessitates efficient system design and validation processes. MBSE provides a framework for capturing system functionality and managing complexity, while SE focuses on testing and analyzing system features across various scenarios. By combining these approaches, system development efforts can be streamlined, leading to more efficient project management. This paper reviews existing literature on MBSE and SE in the context of ADAS development and highlights the potential benefits of their integration. An MBSE workflow is introduced where the key focus is on the behavioral aspects of the system. Additionally, a scenario generation pipeline which constitutes scenario databases is proposed to ensure comprehensive testing of system requirements. Results show that with automated scenario generation, the target vehicle cut-out scenario is successfully realized and simulated based on the formally described system behavior as part of the MBSE model.},

Strategic thinking and leading change concepts were used to analyze reports and presentations on global trends and visionary thinking about the future of systems and digital engineering. The context, strategic time horizon, stakeholders, strategic challenges, strategic advantages, driving forces, and opportunities were considered. The analysis resulted in a future vision of MBSE that shows what NASA systems engineers and digital machines will do to perform rapid, extraordinary, and unprecedented missions. The NASA systems engineer, in this future vision, works with a global project team in a virtual and collaborative environment, engineers the system, and uses digital approaches as the routine and default way of working. The digital machines provide data-driven and automated mission designs; have a backbone of program and project management, systems engineering, and product life-cycle management; and are a knowledge-sharing infrastructure. The NASA systems engineer and the systems engineering team are envisioned to use digital machines to plan and perform rapid exploration missions, develop a digital twin that lasts across the life cycle, and develop enduring and adaptable systems. NASA has an engineering enterprise and a life-cycle management framework that endure, adapt, and respond. A strategy bridge based on the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence Framework and lessons learned from a recent MBSE initiative illuminates a way forward from today to this desired future. The bridge lays out a strategy for leaders and recommends investments of today for immediate benefits and for benefits in 2029.},

TOSA has developed a notional open C4I template which incorporates an OSA. The application of OSA to C4I spaces will increase flexibility, upgradability, scalability, and adaptability and decrease total ownership cost over the lifecycle of the ship. Open systems concepts are well established in the commercial information technology (IT) field as a means to increase competition among vendors (broaden the market applicability and reduce costs). While the benefits of OSA are easily discernable for IT systems, the use of OSA for HM\&E ship systems inter-faces represents a new and unproven application. An important feature of the adaptable ship concept is the Functional Element (FE) zone, which represents physical divisions of a ship with managed functions, configurations, interfaces, and characteristics. This paper describes how the OSA process was applied to develop an example FE Zone template for a specific space, a notional Combat Information Center (CIC) zone. The resulting concept may be used to develop a family of templates to open the remaining Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I) zones on a ship.},

            Today’s social infrastructure, e.g., transportation, medical services, energy supply and distribution, may become temporarily unable to provide functions due to the damage to buildings or excessive congestion resulting from threats, such as natural disasters, rising sea levels, pandemics. Maritime-based responses, typified by hospital ships, are drawing attention as a method to mitigate these effects. However, while designing emergency infrastructure, it is necessary to consider not only the value of these systems in emergencies but also during normal times. This study adopts the systems approach, a set of methods to conduct decision-making when complex stakeholders’ relationships are involved. We focus on medical functions and propose a conceptual design for a flexible hospital ship with dynamic capability during emergencies as well as normal times. Specifically, we examine the optimal combination of ship type, size, navigation range during normal times, operations during emergencies, and contract approaches. Quantitative evaluation of utility during emergencies and economic efficiency are considered in tradeoff. In addition to the conventional cost-based study, we examined benefit–cost through ship sharing, in which ships are leased to the private sector as merchant vessels during normal times to generate revenue.},

The major decision is between converting to a dual fuel liquefied natural gas (LNG) engine or continue alternating between marine diesel oil (MDO) in the ECA zones and heavy fuel oil (HFO) otherwise. The current low cost of LNG makes converting an attractive option; however, uncertainties with fuel prices, fuel supply chain risks, the regulatory framework, conversion costs, and lost revenue, due to reduced TEU capacity, make the decision less obvious. The effect of lost revenue due to LNG fuel tanks, variations in economic discount rates, and fuel supply chain risks are examined in detail over a range of speeds.},

This paper uses the concept of composite reducible Markov processes to identify various independent design absorbing paths. An absorbing path represents the long term behavior of a temporal decision process. This method identiﬁes the set of absorbing paths by decomposing the process into sets of inherently independent parts and thus also gives insight into the structure and relationships of the decision process. This is done by examining the set of principal eigenvectors. Two metrics are introduced. First, the set of principal eigenvectors is used to identify all independent design absorbing paths without the need for full examination of all initial conditions. Second, through the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, the set of principal eigenvectors is used to estimate the optimal life cycle strategy of the decision process. A case study is presented involving life cycle planning for ballast water treatment compliance of a notional container ship to show the utility of these methods and metrics.},

	abstract = {A Monte Carlo approach to the ship-centric Markov decision process (SC-MDP) is presented for analyzing whether a container ship should convert to LNG power in the face of evolving Emission Control Area regulations. The SC-MDP model was originally developed as a means to analyze uncertain, sequential decision making problems. However, the original model is limited in its handling of uncertainty by only using discrete probabilistic values to account for the uncertainty. This paper extends the model to include Monte Carlo simulations to gain a deeper understanding of how uncertainty aﬀects decision making behavior. A case study is presented involving the impact of evolving Emission Control Areas on the design and operation of a notional 13,000 TEU container ship. The decision of whether to invest in a dual fuel LNG engine is analyzed given uncertainties in economic parameters, regulatory scenarios, and supply chain risks. The case study is used to show how variations in uncertain parameters can have a drastic eﬀect on optimal decision strategies.},

	abstract = {Electrical propulsion is not a novel concept in marine systems. However, the availability of power electronic converters has proved to be the Key Enabling Technology for electriﬁcation of large ships. This paper starts with a summary of EP drives, which led to the birth of all-electric ships. Electric power generation and control systems are then presented, which make it possible to exploit the integrated electrical power system. To ease comprehension of the issues in designing such a system, its conventional design process is given. Then, the reasons that are pushing ahead the research in the shipboard power systems sector are discussed. The need for research in the design methods area is demonstrated through an overview of the latest results of technological research. Finally, a summary of the most signiﬁcant results on the design tools research is given, including early stage design, dependable-oriented design, and the improvements achievable through software simulators and hardware-in-the-loop are discussed. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate why research on design methods is as important as a technological one, on the basis of the needs concerning the design, integration, and management of future “integrated electrical and electronic power systems” (power systems with power conversion quota approaching 100\%).},

	abstract = {The paper follows on from a recent IJME paper and summarises a new early-stage ship design approach. This is termed the Network Block Approach (NBA) and combines the advantages of the UCL 3D physically based ship synthesis Design Building Block (DBB) approach and the Virginia Tech originated Architecture Flow Optimisation (AFO) method for distributed ship service systems (DS3). The approach has been applied to submarine DS3 design and utilises: a set of novel frameworks; and Qinetiq’s Paramarine CASD suite features. The proposed NBA enables the development of a submarine concept design to different levels of granularities. These range from modelling individual spaces to locating various DS3 components and system routings. The proposed approach also enables the designer to balance the energy demands of a set of distributed systems. This is done by performing a steady-state flow simulation and visualising the complexity of the submarine DS3 in a 3D multiplex network configuration. The potential benefits and limitations from such a 3D based physical and network synthesis are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the Network Block Approach comparing it to previous applications of network theory which have been to surface ship design. It concludes that it would be possible to better estimate DS3 weight and space inputs to early-stage submarine design and also enable radical submarine configurations and DS3 options to be reflected in early stage submarine design for better concept exploration and requirement elucidation. Finally, further work on the sensitivity of the approach to designer inputs will be addressed in future papers.},

MBSE does not change the practice of Systems Engineering as defined in the INCOSE SE Handbook or ISO/IEEE 15288, but it does affect the way in which systems engineering processes are implemented and supported within and across organizations. Organizations adopting MBSE must address issues such as new skill and competency requirements for systems engineers, model and data management over the lifecycle of the system, and integration with other engineering tools and processes, among others. It is not a tool problem or a modeler problem. It is an enterprise problem and requires an enterprise approach. The approach must be defined and guided by an enterprise architecture, which is broader than just the engineering tools and their interfaces. It includes the enterprise strategic vision, capabilities, operational concepts, organizations, and material solutions required to achieve MBSE adoption, how they relate to one another, and their evolution over time.},

It describes refinements to both C\&RE and AFO, and naval surface combatant concept design case studies. The architectural framework decomposes naval ship distributed systems into the physical, logical, and operational architectures representing the spatial, functional, and temporal relationships of distributed systems respectively. This decomposition greatly simplifies the Mission, Power, and Energy System (MPES) design process for use in C\&RE. AFO is a network-based linear programming optimization method used to design and analyze MPES at a sufficient level of detail to understand system energy flow, define MPES architecture and sizing, reduce system vulnerability and improve system reliability. AFO incorporates system topologies, energy coefficient component models, preliminary arrangements, and (nominal and damaged) steady state scenarios to minimize the energy flow cost required to satisfy all operational scenario demands and constraints. This thesis provides an overview of design tools developed to implement this process and methods, including objective attribute metrics for cost, effectiveness and risk, ship synthesis model, hullform exploration and MPES explorations using design of experiments (DOEs) and response surface models.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a practical design approach for submarine subsystems using a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology. At the core of this approach is a system model that provides a precise, consistent, traceable and integrated description of the submarine subsystem architecture. The system model is used to support the flow-down of requirements from the submarine missions to system, to subsystem and to component specifications. The system model is defined in the OMG Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML™) and implemented in an established commercial SysML graphical modelling tool. The MBSE approach is based on a combination of industry best practice and the practical experiences of deploying MBSE within a submarine design team. This approach is being used by the design team at both whole-ofsubmarine and subsystem levels of design. This paper will elaborate on the application of MBSE to submarine subsystem architecture and focus on modelling artefacts that provide direct benefit during the early stages of achieving a balanced submarine design. This paper will discuss a number of important topics associated with building a system model that is intended to evolve from an initial concept design over the lifecycle of the submarine. Of particular interest is the reference architecture ‘scaffolding’ used to support capabilities such as variant modelling, and the integration of Failure Modes \& Effects Analysis (FMEA) within the system model.},

	abstract = {Naval ships building requires numerous domains of expertise raising a major challenge to design, produce, support and retire a system that is composed of thousands of equipment’s and features, and which will be operated by different navies for several missions around the globe. Coming with the digitalization of the ships, the success of MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) approach in software-intensive systems has led major industrial actors, of which Naval Group, to adopt MBSE for large scale projects. Nowadays industry has to go further, as more and more systems have interactions between each other in a systems-of-systems prospective, as well as MBSE is becoming more mature. One major challenge is to run an efficient system engineering process, because it will secure the following other phases of the product lifecycle. The system engineering system required for an Aircraft-carrier, frigates and submarines design and development involves numerous companies and teams, in several domains of expertise. The number and the complexity of the involved enabling systems are also important: requirement and quality management tools, modelling and simulation tools, 3D design tools, etc... The communications between those teams, as well as the interfaces between those tools, are key points for a good design phase. So this paper proposes to take an MBSE approach to enhance these communications during the engineering phases, and to enable this integration between the different enabling systems that supports the engineering process. Another advantage is to establish the numerical continuum between the several engineering levels, domains and data, and to enhance automation of this integration by using the power of the model-based standards and associated frameworks. The innovation comes from the idea of engineering a new enabling system, able to define the system engineering integrated toolchain, tailored for each complex socio-technical system engineering process, and that this engineering is not performed by tool vendor, but by the target program team. So to define this system, we have tried to apply the fundamental principles of system engineering, onto the engineering system it-self, within a model-based approach: (i) the specification first, by giving more details on the motivations, second by expressing a simple set of requirements, modelled in a set of functions; (ii) the enterprise architecture modelling through a set of artefacts representing the System Engineering meta-model, and a first level of allocation; (iii) At last, as an early validation phase, where the relevancy and benefits of this approach will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Prior to the introduction of computers into Early Stage Ship Design of complex vessels, such as naval ships, the approach to synthesising a new design had been via weight equations. When it was realised that modern naval vessels (and some sophisticated service vessels) were essentially space driven initial (numerical) sizing needed to balance weight and space, together with simple checks on resistance \& powering, plus sufficient intact stability (i.e. simple metacentric height assurance). All this was quickly computerised and subsequently put on a spread-sheet to iteratively achieve weight and space balance, while meeting those simple stability and R\&P checks. Thus suddenly it became possible to produce very many variants, for both trade-off of certain requirements (against initial acquisition cost) as well (apparently) optimal solutions. However as this paper argues this speeding up of a very crude synthesis approach, before rapidly proceeding into feasibility investigations of the “selected design”, has not led to a quicker overall design process, nor have new ship designs been brought earlier into service, in timeframes remotely comparable to most merchant ships.},

	abstract = {The polynomial chaos (PC) expansion has been widely used as a surrogate model in the Bayesian inference to speed up the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) calculations. However, the use of a PC surrogate introduces the modeling error, that may severely distort the estimate of the posterior distribution. This error can be corrected by increasing the order of the PC expansion, but the cost for building the surrogate may increase dramatically. In this work, we seek to address this challenge by proposing an adaptive procedure to construct a multi-ﬁdelity PC surrogate. This new strategy combines (a large number of) low-ﬁdelity surrogate model evaluations and (a small number of) high-ﬁdelity model evaluations, yielding an adaptive multi-ﬁdelity approach. Here the low-ﬁdelity surrogate is chosen as the prior-based PC surrogate, while the high-ﬁdelity model refers to the true forward model. The key idea is to construct and reﬁne the multi-ﬁdelity approach over a sequence of samples adaptively determined from data so that the approximation can eventually concentrate on the posterior distribution. We illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy through two nonlinear inverse problems. It is shown that the proposed adaptive multi-ﬁdelity approach can improve signiﬁcantly the accuracy, yet without a dramatic increase in computational complexity. The numerical results also indicate that our new algorithm can enhance the eﬃciency by several orders of magnitude compared to a standard MCMC approach using only the true forward model.},

Given a stochastic input with an arbitrary probability measure, its random space is decomposed into smaller elements. Subsequently, in each element a new random variable with respect to a conditional probability density function (PDF) is deﬁned, and a set of orthogonal polynomials in terms of this random variable is constructed numerically. Then, the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method is implemented element-by-element. Numerical experiments show that the cost for the construction of orthogonal polynomials is negligible compared to the total time cost. Eﬃciency and convergence of ME-gPC are studied numerically by considering some commonly used random variables. ME-gPC provides an eﬃcient and ﬂexible approach to solving diﬀerential equations with random inputs, especially for problems related to long-term integration, large perturbation, and stochastic discontinuities.},

	abstract = {Generating ship arrangements is inherently a problem of identifying the spatial regions to be occupied by shipboard elements while balancing the impact on performance. Traditionally, elements are assigned a Cartesian coordinate location, and the allocation problem is solved in three-dimensional space. The coordinates for each subsequent element are selected by considering the element's interactions with placed and yet-to-be-placed elements. This paper presents a new approach to ship arrangements that starts with a non-spatial, network theory-based perspective and results in the traditional assignment of shipboard items to designated structural zones. Network partitioning is used to identify groups of mutually compatible ship elements, termed communities. A metric is introduced to express each community's cumulative preference to be located in speciﬁed regions of the ship. The cumulative preferences are used in a direct community-to-structural zone seeding procedure that creates reasonable initial compartment allocations. The rudimentary design knowledge required to position a particular set of shipboard elements using the proposed methods is ideally suited to early-stage design processes.},

This software system is intended to be used following or as a latter part of ASSET synthesis. The arrangement process is approached as two essentially two-dimensional tasks. First, the spaces are allocated to Zone-decks, one deck in one vertical zone, on the ship’s inboard profile. Then the assigned spaces are arranged in detail on the deck plan of each Zone-deck in succession. Consideration is given to overall location, adjacency, separation, access, area requirements, area utilization, and compartment shape. The system architecture is quite general to facilitate its evolution to address additional design issues, such as distributive system design, in the future.},

We additionally show that the limit is a random binary R-tree and has Minkowski dimension 3 almost surely. In particular, its law is mutually singular with that of the Brownian continuum random tree or any rescaled version thereof. Our approach relies on a coupling between the MST problem and the Erd{\textbackslash}"os-R{\textbackslash}'enyi random graph. We exploit the explicit description of the scaling limit of the Erd{\textbackslash}"os-R{\textbackslash}'enyi random graph in the so-called critical window, established by the first three authors in an earlier paper, and provide a similar description of the scaling limit for a "critical minimum spanning forest" contained within the MST.},

	abstract = {The Naval Ship Design Concept and Requirements Exploration (C\&RE) process used at Virginia 
Tech is based on a Multi-Objective Optimization approach that explores the design space to identify a 
Non-Dominated set of ship design solutions ranked by cost, risk, and effectiveness. The current method of 
calculating an Overall Measure of Effectiveness (OMOE) used in this approach is based on expert 
opinion and pairwise comparison. Despite the good results obtained using expert opinion, more direct 
physics-based Operational Effectiveness Models (OEMs) starting with a detailed Design Reference 
Mission (DRM) including mission Operational Situations (OpSits), conditions, and measures may provide 
greater confidence in the validity of the results and a perception that results are more unbiased and 
rational.
This paper describes a method for building a Design Reference Mission (DRM) composed of multiple 
Operational Situations (OpSits) required by the ship’s mission. The DRM is defined using a Model 
Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach and a Total-Ship System Architecture to define and 
understand the relationships between various aspects of the ship design and their relationship to 
operational effectiveness. The system architecture is based on the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF 
2.0). It includes the DRM and enables the development of Operational Effectiveness Models (OEMs) as 
an alternative to an expert opinion-based OMOE. 
A notional US Coast Guard (USCG) Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) is used as an example in this 
paper. The ship design architecture and Design Reference Mission are based on the OPV mission 
requirement specified in a notional Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)},

However, the original model is limited in its handling of uncertainty by only using discrete probabilistic values to account for the uncertainty. This paper extends the model to include Monte Carlo simulations to gain a deeper understanding of how uncertainty aﬀects decision making behavior. A case study is presented involving the impact of evolving Emission Control Areas on the design and operation of a notional 13,000 TEU container ship. The decision of whether to invest in a dual fuel LNG engine is analyzed given uncertainties in economic parameters, regulatory scenarios, and supply chain risks.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a decision-making model for forecasting design and decision paths in ship design by applying eigenvector analysis to the ship-centric Markov decision process (SC-MDP) model. This paper uses the concept of composite reducible Markov processes to identify various independent design absorbing paths. An absorbing path represents the long term behavior of a temporal decision process. This method identiﬁes the set of absorbing paths by decomposing the process into sets of inherently independent parts and thus also gives insight into the structure and relationships of the decision process. This is done by examining the set of principal eigenvectors. Two metrics are introduced. First, the set of principal eigenvectors is used to identify all independent design absorbing paths without the need for full examination of all initial conditions. Second, through the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, the set of principal eigenvectors is used to estimate the optimal life cycle strategy of the decision process. A case study is presented involving life cycle planning for ballast water treatment compliance of a notional container ship to show the utility of these methods and metrics.},

	abstract = {The design and realization of future zero emission power and energy systems on board ships is a challenging process. The resulting systems are complex, multi-disciplinary and need to be introduced in one radical step. A well-structured methodology is needed that ensures all requirements are addressed and risks are being reduced already early in the design process. This paper shows how Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) can be used to mitigate risks, keep clear traceability of user needs, functional requirements and physical realizations, and help designers to approach a design as a multi-disciplinary exercise. A 25m inland patrol vessel is taken as an example and systematically the MBSE steps are addressed touching upon the user needs, system architecture setup, logical arrangement up and the physical conceptual design of the power and energy system in the ship. The example case shows how a well-structured requirements analysis leads to specific system design choices and helps to identify support system requirements in an early stage of the design, well before basic engineering starts. This structured design approach lays the foundation for further simulation and testing (verification and validation) of the resulting systems, which will be addressed in future publications.},

The derived formula uses only a few input, including only some ship dimensions to yield an estimation of the added resistance of ships in regular waves. Numerical results show that the added resistance of various ships in head seas at low speeds, as well as the added resistance of tankers in ballast condition and cruise ships, can be properly captured by the new formula. Hence, it meets the demand of fast examination of the minimum power; it can also be used in the early design stage of a ship for power estimation.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process.
Method: We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the SR process. Studies were classiﬁed with respect to the stage in the SR process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools.
Results: We identiﬁed 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difﬁcult.
Conclusion: We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would beneﬁt from tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical methods remains a major problem.},

Based on the analysis of the data extraction process, we discuss the primary trends and approaches and present the identified obstacles.

In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of MBSE remains inconclusive.},

            This paper aims to examine and document the current state of practice of model‐based systems engineering (MBSE), and how organizations look toward the future. The paper is based on a survey of how MBSE has been applied and factors that influenced the perceived benefits and results. The survey was designed to evaluate the maturity and status of the implementation of MBSE (also called model‐centric systems engineering), within industry, academia, and governments. The approach to the survey development is described along with the survey results. The study indicates that one of the main hurdles to introducing a model‐based approach is the lack of clear and adopted organizational structures and an understanding of required conditions and needs at a management level. The survey also indicates that 50–75\% of the respondents noted some improvement or a significant improvement across almost all systems engineering tasks.},

            Model‐based systems engineering (MBSE) is part of a long‐term trend toward model‐centric approaches adopted by many engineering disciplines. We establish the need of an MBSE approach by reviewing the importance, complexity, and vulnerability of the U.S. chemical supply chains. We discuss the origins, work processes, modeling approaches, and supporting tools of the systems engineering discipline (SE) and discuss limitations of the Process Systems Engineering (PSE) framework. We make the case for MBSE as a more generalizable approach. We introduce systems modeling strategies for MBSE, and a novel MBSE method that supports the automation tailored and extended to support the analysis of chemical supply chains. We demonstrate a specific use case of this method by creating a systems model for the manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, Atropine. We conclude with a prospectus on developmental opportunities for extracting greater benefit from MBSE in the design and management of chemical supply chains.},

	abstract = {Naval ships are designed to operate in a hostile environment. As such, vulnerability is an important aspect that needs to be assessed during the design. With the increased interest in electrification and automation on board naval ships, the vulnerability of distributed systems has become a major topic of interest. However, assessing this is not trivial, especially during the concept phase, where the level of detail is limited, but consequences of design decisions are large. Many existing vulnerability methods assess the vulnerability of pre-defined concepts, and focus on systems rather than capabilities. To address this, a new method for assessing the vulnerability of distributed systems in the concept phase has been developed. This method not only evaluates the vulnerability of a pre-defined concept, but also provides direction for finding other, potentially better solutions. This is done from a capabilities perspective. The method helps ship designers and naval staff in setting vulnerability requirements, developing new concepts, and identifying trade-offs in capabilities. The method uses a discrete Markov chain and the eigenvalues of the associated transition matrix. A test case considering vulnerability of a notional Ocean-going Patrol Vessel (OPV) with two different powering concepts illustrates the method.},

	abstract = {A fully autonomous ship should be monitored in a digital environment to track its real-time response to the changes in its surroundings. It is commanded by a controller algorithm whose optimum parameters is subject to change with respect to the changes in the environment. The ship’s response with respect to these variations in the controller parameters need to be tracked to develop a full understanding of the ship’s autonomy. As such, it is believed that the digital twin of a ship is an essential component of the path to fully autonomous ships. Despite maritime institutions not giving the credit to it yet, the ship digital twin concept is expected to be one of the leading topics in marine engineering soon. In this study, we try to establish the ship digital twin concept in terms of navigation autonomy. The paper starts by introducing the path to full autonomy in seas and the need for the digital twin by defining this concept for ships. A maneuvering mathematical model is used to represent the physical ship. The details of the model and the controller algorithms are given next. The propeller and rudder models are first validated by free-running self-propulsion and turning circle tests. The ship considered in this study has a twisted rudder and does not possess course-keeping ability; therefore, it requires autopilot to move straight ahead. Three types of simulation cases are identified with one being the autopilot mode. In the other two cases, the ship is forced to conduct two hard maneuvers while accelerating/decelerating. Investigation of the generated results reveals the effectiveness of the digital twin architecture used in this study. It has also allowed us to conduct a controller stability analysis, which has shown the behavior of the controller gains to detect the most optimum values for the considered model ship.},

Being anchored in the scientific inquiry tradition, research validation is strongly tied to a fundamental problem addressed in epistemology, namely, what is scientific knowledge and how is new knowledge confirmed? Thus, we first look to epistemology for answers to why an approach solely based on 'formal, rigorous and quantifiable' validation constitutes a problem, and for an augmented approach to research validation. We then propose the 'Validation Square' which we validate by testing its internal consistency based on logic in addition to testing its external relevance based on its usefulness with respect to a purpose. We recognize that no one has the complete answer to the question we pose. To help us converge on an answer to these questions we "think aloud" and invite you to join us in doing the same. It is our hope that in so doing we, the members of this design research community, will all be the richer for it .},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for analyzing distributed ship systems. The increase in interconnected and interdependent systems aboard modern naval vessels has signiﬁcantly increased their complexity, making them more vulnerable to cascading failures and emergent behavior that arise only once the system is complete and in operation. There is a need for a systematic approach to describe and analyze distributed systems at the conceptual stage for naval vessels. Understanding the relationships between various aspects of these distributed systems is crucial for uninterrupted naval operations and vessel survivability. The framework introduced in this paper decomposes information about an individual system into three views: the physical, logical, and operational architectural representations. These representations describe the spatial and functional relationships of the system, together with their temporal behavior characteristics. This paper deﬁnes how these primary architectural representations are used to describe a system, the interrelations between the architectural blocks, and how those blocks ﬁt together. A list of deﬁned terms is presented, and a preliminary set of requirements for speciﬁc design tools to model these architectures is discussed. A practical application is introduced to illustrate how the framework can be used to describe the delivery of power to a high energy weapon.},

To support this objective, this study examines the challenges and uncertainties associated with implementing a methanol power propulsion and energy (PPE) system on the design of a vessel. This paper argues that new fuels, such as methanol, should be treated as disruptive innovations due, in part, to the uncertainties surrounding their implementation. Their integration causes challenges regarding systems selection, layout design, and maintaining strict safety measures. In the case of methanol, current research treats the fuel as a system conversion based on diesel fuel. This paper provides a review of the stateof-the-art on the design of methanol fuelled vessels, and identifies a research gap related to the need for a new suitable design method for the design of ships integrating future alternatively fuelled PPE systems. A design approach inspired by model-based systems engineering integrating uncertainty modelling is proposed to examine the influence of uncertainty on the design of the vessels. The impact of uncertainty on the design is investigated through a case study of a simplified engine room layout utilizing a genetic algorithm to produce layouts for variable PPE systems dimensions within a Monte Carlo simulation.},

	abstract = {Prior to the introduction of computers into Early Stage Ship Design of complex vessels, such as naval ships, the approach to synthesising a new design had been via weight equations. When it was realised that modern naval vessels (and some sophisticated service vessels) were essentially space driven initial (numerical) sizing needed to balance weight and space, together with simple checks on resistance \& powering, plus sufficient intact stability (i.e. simple metacentric height assurance). All this was quickly computerised and subsequently put on a spread-sheet to iteratively achieve weight and space balance, while meeting those simple stability and R\&P checks. Thus suddenly it became possible to produce very many variants, for both trade-off of certain requirements (against initial acquisition cost) as well (apparently) optimal solutions. However as this paper argues this speeding up of a very crude synthesis approach, before rapidly proceeding into feasibility investigations of the “selected design”, has not led to a quicker overall design process, nor have new ship designs been brought earlier into service, in timeframes remotely comparable to most merchant ships.},

	abstract = {The focus on digitalisation in manufacturing is spreading to other industry fields, including large and complex objects like ships. Such interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships.},

This may produce ambiguities at times: for example, does “management” refer to management of the SE process, or management of the system being engineered? As with many special disciplines, SE uses terms in ways that may be unfamiliar outside the discipline. For example, in systems science and therefore SE, “open” means that a system is able to interact with its environment--as opposed to being "closed” to its environment. But in the broader engineering world we would read “open” to mean “non-proprietary” or “publicly agreed upon.” In such cases, the SEBoK tries to avoid misinterpretation by elaborating the alternatives e.g. “system management” or “systems engineering management”.},

This chapter introduces the systems engineering approach independent of modeling concepts to set the context for how SysML is used. Systems engineering is a multidisciplinary approach that is intended to transform a set of stakeholder needs into a balanced system solution that meets those needs. Systems engineering is a key practice to address complex and often technologically challenging problems. The systems engineering process includes activities to establish top-level goals that a system must support, specify system requirements, synthesize alternative system designs, evaluate the alternatives, allocate requirements to the components, integrate the components into the system, and verify that the system requirements are satisfied. It also includes essential planning and control processes needed to manage a technical effort. Multidisciplinary teams are an essential element of systems engineering to address the diverse stakeholder perspectives and technical domains to achieve a balanced system solution. The practice of systems engineering continues to evolve with an emphasis on dealing with systems as part of a larger whole. Systems engineering practices are becoming codified in various standards, which is essential to advancing and institutionalizing the practice across industry domains.},

This review article aims to offer an extensive survey on state-of-the-art process systems engineering (PSE) approaches for process intensification. From both academic and industrial perspectives, this paper provides an overview of the development of various process intensification technologies, specifically those under the categories of separation, reaction, hybrid reaction/separation, and alternative energy sources. A current status analysis in the areas of modeling and simulation is then provided. An indicative list of PSE publications specialized on process intensification is presented to illustrate the progresses made so far towards the deployment of novel process intensification technologies. We also highlight some recent advances for the modeling, design, and synthesis of intensified systems, as well as for the assessment of their controllability/operability/safety performance. Key open questions in these areas include: (i) how to systematically derive intensified designs, and (ii) how to ensure the operability and optimality of the derived intensified structures while delivering their expected functionality.},

	abstract = {This Article shows that fintech exacerbates the difficulties of standard setting in international financial regulation. Earlier work introduced the “Innovation Trilemma” (the Trilemma). When seeking to balance the goals of achieving market integrity and innovation through clear and simple rulemaking, regulators can—at best—achieve only two out of these three objectives. Fintech’s unique characteristics—a reliance on automation and artificial intelligence, novel types of big data, as well as the use of disintermediating financial supply chains comprising a mix of traditional firms as well as technology specialists and newcomers—complicates the application of the Trilemma. Rulemaking struggles to achieve needed clarity where innovative algorithms introduce informational uncertainties and complex risks for market integrity. Further, regulation’s ability to impose compliance costs on firms in response to these risks is limited when a preference for innovation favors smaller upstarts and nontraditional players.International financial regulation presents even steeper challenges when viewed through the lens of the Trilemma. First, rules clarity is harder to achieve owing to divergences in national legal systems, administrative processes, and market structures. Secondly, fintech increases negotiation costs in international standard setting owing to the emergence of a much more expansive cast of economies—like China and India—that dominate as fintech hubs alongside the traditional power players such as the United States or European Union (EU). With distinctive policy preferences, emerging economies constitute powerful voices that mean that negotiation must account for a wider range of distributive preferences. Finally, standard setting must bridge the particularities of domestic market structures that are experiencing varying degrees of disintermediation and transformations in financial supply chains. Rules that impose high compliance costs may be acceptable to economies dominated by traditional intermediaries but may lack buy-in from those where nonbank firms hold sway. In concluding, this Article briefly surveys strategies for fostering greater global cooperation in standard setting for fintech.},

	abstract = {Vibration modes of a submarine are excited by fluctuating forces generated at the propeller and transmitted to the hull via the propeller-shafting system. The low frequency vibrational modes of the hull can result in significant sound radiation. This work investigates reduction of the far-field radiated sound pressure from a submarine using a resonance changer implemented in the propulsion system as well as design modifications to the propeller-shafting system attachment to the hull. The submarine hull is modeled as a fluid-loaded ring-stiffened cylindrical shell with truncated conical end caps. The propeller-shafting system is modeled in a modular approach using a combination of mass-spring-damper elements, beams, and shells. The stern end plate of the hull, to which the foundation of the propeller-shafting system is attached, is modeled as a circular plate coupled to an annular plate. The connection radius of the foundation to the stern end plate is shown to have a great influence on the structural and acoustic responses and is optimized in a given frequency range to reduce the radiated noise. Optimum connection radii for a range of cost functions based on the maximum radiated sound pressure are obtained for both simple support and clamped attachments of the foundation to the hull stern end plate. A hydraulic vibration attenuation device known as a resonance changer is implemented in the dynamic model of the propeller-shafting system. A combined genetic and pattern search algorithm was used to find the optimum virtual mass, stiffness, and damping parameters of the resonance changer. The use of a resonance changer in conjunction with an optimized connection radius is shown to give a significant reduction in the low frequency structure-borne radiated sound.},

Stiffness models of the DVA with negative stiffness, which is composed of a rubber pad and a Belleville spring, are established. An analytical model of the shafting system with and without the proposed DVA is set up by employing the equivalent model of a propeller and employed to perform vibration control in the low frequency range. A stability analysis is carried out and optimal parameters of the DVA with negative stiffness are obtained. A parametric study is also carried out to investigate the inﬂuence of the parameters of the DVA and negative stiffness on the vibration suppression for a speciﬁc shaft. A design scheme to obtain the static and dynamic stiffness of Belleville springs under different operation conditions is given, which takes into consideration variation in oil stiffness of the thrust bearing and propeller static thrust. Compared with a traditional DVA, the proposed DVA with negative stiffness achieves enhanced vibration transmission suppression performance for a much broader absorber frequency range around resonance and with a much smaller size of mass, which is very favorable for a marine shafting system.},

	abstract = {Low speed large engines such as those found in marine applications or power plants present large and ﬂexible crankshafts. These elements as well as all the others linked to them, such as the pistons, connecting rods, camshaft and the ﬂywheel, form a torsional system of nonlinear nature for which it is very worthwhile to identify and solve relevant anomalies such as efﬁciency losses, power imbalance or injection system malfunctions. This work presents a torsional nonlinear model of a two-stroke low speed diesel engine that has been developed and validated through experiments, using the instantaneous torque (IT) between the generator and engine as the validation magnitude. The analysed system loads covered the whole operational range of the system, i.e. 55\%, 70\%, 85\% and 100\% of the engine’s attainable power. The lumped torsional system was modelled with 16 degrees of freedom and was solved applying Fourier series expansion for the linear part of the system and with an iterative procedure for the nonlinear character of the system dynamics, which requires up to 12 iterations. A parameter model identiﬁcation process was performed in Section 4 due to the uncertainty between the data supplied by the manufacturer and real data. As a result, the maximum error between the model and experimental data was reduced to 1.5\%. In Section 5 a parametric study was developed that made it possible to establish the relationship between the in-cylinder combustion process and IT. This knowledge is taken into account in Section 6 to generate a proper set of inputs and outputs which is used to train an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN). Once trained, this network simulates the indicated mean power (WMI) at each cylinder with an error less than 1\% for any load and engine condition. The main goal of the work is to develop a diagnostic tool for the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of combustion-related anomalies that can contribute to maintaining the system efﬁciency as new.},

This paper concerns with the fast uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the stochastic dynamics for the marine shafting systems suffered propeller excitation and parameter uncertainties in bearing stiffnesses. A statistical surrogate model issued from the associating of a transfer matrix model for describing the shafting system together with a sparse generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) formalism for propagating probabilistic uncertainties is developed for the first time. A variance-based global sensitivity analysis is performed by evaluating Sobol indices from gPCE to quantitatively distinguish the relative importance of individual uncertain parameters and their interactions on the random vibration responses. The effects of uncertainties on the stochastic dynamic properties of the shafting system are subsequently investigated through the analysis of the uncertainty envelopes and probability density functions (PDFs) of the frequency responses, along with the associated sensitivity indices. Numerical results are compared with those obtained from the MCS with a large number of realizations, demonstrating the accuracy and significant computational advantage of the proposed methodology.},

The use of simple combustion models such as the Wiebe function to analyze or predict the combustion process in such retrofitted engines can accelerate and optimize the engine conversion. This study compared the standard single Wiebe function to a double-Wiebe function to investigate if the latter will improve the predicted mass fraction burned and, if yes, which of formats of the duel-Wiebe function in the literature described the best the mass fraction burned in such converted engine. The results showed that while the standard Wiebe function could not predict the mass fraction, a double-Wiebe function (one for the fast burn inside the piston bowl and a second for the slower burning process inside the squish region) predicted with good accuracy the mass fraction burned, heat release rate, in-cylinder pressure, and combustion phasing in such converted engines (∼90\% reduction in error) for the conditions investigated here, especially if the start of the second Wiebe was delayed. Moreover, such a condition-dependent model as the double-Wiebe model is limited to the operating conditions used for determining the model parameters. However, the model can be developed into a condition-independent model if enough experimental data or CFD simulations are available to find the unique set (or sets) of parameters that minimizes the error at most conditions.},

An accurate and applicable numerical model for the coupled vibrations of marine propeller shaft is thus proposed to solve this problem. This non-linear model with ordinary diﬀerential equations is analytical calculated on the basis of high order Runge-Kutta method. Experiments are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed model through the comparison with numerical calculation, over a range of rotational speeds.

The excitations of the pump-jet are obtained by CFD and the vibro-acoustic responses are predicted by coupled FEM/BEM. A mapping method based on radial basis function is established between CFD and structural mesh to apply the distributed pulsation forces on the wet surface of the pump-jet. The effect of the method used to apply the excitation forces on vibro-acoustic responses is investigated by applying distributed or equivalent pulsation forces at different areas of the pump-jet. Modal shapes, transmitted forces, sound radi­ ation power, radiation directivity pattern and panel contributions are reported to illustrate the characteristics of the vibro-acoustic responses and the influence of the method used to apply the excitation forces on the responses. It is seen that the shaft frequency and the longitudinal mode resonant frequency of the shafting system are the typical characteristic frequencies with large magnitude in vibro-acoustic responses of the coupled system. Compared with applying concentrated forces applied at hub or 0.7 R, the responses produced by applying distributed forces on the whole pump-jet present modes and excitation characteristics with more reasonable magnitudes, illustrating the importance of applying distribute forces instead of concentrated forces. Besides, the contribution of the distributed forces on rotor is dominant since the responses of applying distributed forces on the pump-jet and applying distributed forces on rotor are similar.},

	abstract = {The crankshaft dynamics model is of vital importance to a multitude of aspects on engine diagnostics; however, systematic investigations of such models performance (especially for large two-stroke diesel engines that are widely used in the power generation and shipping industries) have not been reported in the literature. This study aims to cover this gap by systematically investigating the parameters that affect the performance of a two-stroke diesel engine crankshaft dynamics model, such as the numerical scheme as well as the engine components inertia and friction. Speciﬁcally, the following alternatives are analysed: (a) two optimal performing numerical schemes, in particular, a stiff ordinary differential equations (ODE) solver and a fast solver based on a piecewise Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) scheme method, (b) the linear and the non-linear inertia-speed approaches, and (c) three engine friction submodels of varying complexity. All the potential combinations of the alternatives are investigated, and the crankshaft dynamics model performance is evaluated by employing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which consider the results accuracy compared to the measured data, the computational time, and the energy balance error. The results demonstrate that the best performing combination includes the stiff ODE solver, the constant inertia-speed approach and the most simplistic engine friction submodel. However, the LTI numerical scheme is recommended for applications that require fast response due to the signiﬁcant savings in computational time with an acceptable compromise in the model results accuracy.},

	abstract = {Accurate simulation of wind turbines is the key to achieve efficient control of wind turbines and optimal scheduling of wind power systems. Most of the existing methods are physical simulation models, which have heavy computational burden, especially for large-scale wind turbines, and the simulation accuracy is poor under complex dynamic operating conditions. In response, this paper proposes a hybrid physical and data driven model for dynamic operation characteristic simulation of wind turbines. Firstly, a database of dynamic characteristics of wind turbine operation under various wind conditions is constructed, and then the sequence learning (Seq2Seq) model is used to mine the time series characteristics of wind turbine operation parameters. Combining with long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the mapping relationship between various operating parameter time series to establish. On this basis, an attention mechanism is added to the model to learn the dynamic response char­ acteristics of rotor inertia to natural wind process. Through numerical example analysis, the method proposed in this paper can accurately excavate and learn the time sequence dynamic characteristics of wind turbine operating conditions and parameters under various wind conditions, thereby improving the simulation accuracy and calculation efficiency of wind turbine output power and load dynamic characteristics. Taking the actual wind turbine operation data as an example, the simulation accuracy of wind turbine output power reaches 99.8\%. Compared with traditional methods, and the simulation accuracy of tower root load reaches 88.5\%.},

The results show that the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting could be significantly affected by the uncertainty. With the increase of uncertainty, the fluctuation of the frequency response function gradually strengthens, the amplitude of the displacement response is enlarged, and the axis trajectory of the propulsion shafting becomes more complex.

	abstract = {Rayleigh damping is commonly used to provide a source of energy dissipation in analyses of structures responding to dynamic loads such as earthquake ground motions. In a ÿnite element model, the Rayleigh damping matrix consists of a mass-proportional part and a sti ness-proportional part; the latter typically uses the initial linear sti ness matrix of the structure. Under certain conditions, for example, a nonlinear analysis with softening non-linearity, the damping forces generated by such a matrix can become unrealistically large compared to the restoring forces, resulting in an analysis being unconservative. Potential problems are demonstrated in this paper through a series of examples. A remedy to these problems is proposed in which bounds are imposed on the damping forces.

	abstract = {Today's largest supercomputers have 100,000s of processor cores and offer the potential to solve partial differential equations discretized by billions of unknowns. However, the complexity of scaling to such large machines and problem sizes has so far prevented the emergence of generic software libraries that support such computations, although these would lower the threshold of entry and enable many more applications to benefit from large-scale computing.
            We are concerned with providing this functionality for mesh-adaptive finite element computations. We assume the existence of an “oracle” that implements the generation and modification of an adaptive mesh distributed across many processors, and that responds to queries about its structure. Based on querying the oracle, we develop scalable algorithms and data structures for generic finite element methods. Specifically, we consider the parallel distribution of mesh data, global enumeration of degrees of freedom, constraints, and postprocessing. Our algorithms remove the bottlenecks that typically limit large-scale adaptive finite element analyses.
            We demonstrate scalability of complete finite element workflows on up to 16,384 processors. An implementation of the proposed algorithms, based on the open source software p4est as mesh oracle, is provided under an open source license through the widely used deal.II finite element software library.},

Afterwards, a node-based shape optimization is invoked to obtain an exact boundary representation. A specialized, optimality criteria-based design update is formulated for the shape optimization. To avoid impractical hinges with point connections, stress constraints are imposed. The stress constraints are imposed using two strategies: Local stress constraints on the nodes of the boundary or global P-norm stress constraints in the domain. Further, an adaptive shape refinement strategy is adopted to increase the design space of shape optimization and to capture the fine-scale details of the geometry. Finally, numerical experiments are presented, showing that the proposed approach can be effectively applied to the design of compliant mechanisms with stress constraints.},

	abstract = {To accurately describe the dynamic features of inter-shaft bearings with localized defect under operation, the dynamic model of inter-shaft bearing with localized defects was established with respect to time-varying displacement excitation. Based on fault simulations on a birotor experimental rig, the developed dynamic model of inter-shaft bearing is validated to have high accuracy (over 99\%) when localized defects happen on inner and outer race with co- and counter-rotation, which indicates that the model can be adopted to simulate the faults of inter-shaft bearing instead of experiment. Through investigation of the square-root (SR) amplitudes of bearing vibration with different defect sizes, radial loads, and rotational directions, we find that the SR amplitudes of bearing vibration increase with increasing defect size and radial load for both co- and counter-rotation. The amplitudes of counter-rotation are larger than those of co-rotation for inner race and outer race, and the amplitude of inner race defect are larger than that of outer race defect for the same defect size or same radial load. This work reveals the SR variation of bearing vibration with localized surface defects under different defect sizes and radial loads, and accurately describes the dynamic characteristics of inter-shaft bearing with localized defects. The efforts of this study open a door to adopt a dynamic model in the future to evaluate and monitor the health condition of inter-shaft bearings in an aeroengine or other rotating machinery.},

To reduce the axial vibration of the coupled propeller-shaft system, the influence and location of the vibration isolator on the structural and acoustic responses is presented. Simulation results demonstrate that utilizing the relationship between the natural frequency of the propeller and the resonance frequency range of the shaft can control the vibration of the coupled system without other vibration control method.

In this paper, one-dimension Timoshenko beam-type model, including the effects of gyroscopic moments, rotary inertias, bending and shear deformations, and three-dimension model for dual-rotor system with inter-shaft bearing are developed. Critical speed tests of dual-rotor are carried out to verify the analytical results. Based on the finite element models, the first critical speed excited by inner rotor and the first two critical speeds excited by outer rotor are calculated. The comparisons between both finite element models indicate that 1D model costs less time, which can be used to predict the critical speeds. Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results shows the accuracy of the FE models.

            This paper presents a novel analytical solution for journal-bearing viscoelastic lubrication using the perturbation method. The nonlinear Giesekus model was used for the constitutive equations to study the effects of fluid elasticity, shear-thinning viscometric functions, and strain-hardening elongational viscosity of viscoelastic lubrication. The investigation focuses on the impact of characteristic parameters such as mobility factor, eccentricity ratio, and Weissenberg number on the fluid film pressure distribution, load capacity, and shear stress. Although distinguishing between the normal stress differences and extensional viscosity in mixed viscoelastic flows is complicated, we investigated the role and contribution of these two factors. By increasing the elasticity of the fluid, the portion of both mentioned parameters increases consequently. Furthermore, analyses and comparisons show the contributions of the first normal stress and elongational viscosity to the load capacity of the bearing through the stress ratio and flow type parameter for the first time. The research findings indicate that fluid elasticity enhances the load capacity of the bearing compared to a Newtonian lubricant with the same effective viscosity. Moreover, the bearing load capacity is divided into two regions. In the linear region, the mobility factor and Weissenberg numbers have minimal effects leading to a linear increase in the load distribution, and in the exponential region, the load capacity changes are considerable. This research provides valuable insights into the behavior of viscoelastic lubrication in journal-bearing systems.},

	abstract = {Constitutive equations are suggested for describing the behavior of elastic-plastic materials undergoing large strains. A special kinematical viewpoint is taken, so that the elastic and plastic deformation processes can be considered separately. This separation is also accommodated by a simplified thermodynamical theory of the deformation process. The elastic constitutive equation is written as a rate equation, after examining the interpretation of elastic isotropy in view of the particular kinematical description employed. To describe plastic deformation, a rate equation, which exhibits no dependence on the rate at which previous states have been traversed, is suggested. After the general relations have been put in appropriate form some simplifications based on physical assumptions are considered. The physical assumptions are based on the behavior of metals under large stress, high speed loading, such as in the penetration problem. Under these operating conditions, the thermoelastic effects dominate and plasticity plays a minor role. Consequently, a simple model of plastic deformation usually suffices. The analysis is presented in direct (matrix) notation and is valid for arbitrary stress states.},

	abstract = {Received 18 December 2022 O Revised 21 April 2023 Accepted 23 April 2023 O This article examines the potential implications of using iron powder as an alternative fuel on the deR sign and performance of container ships. Iron powder is a relatively new alternative energy carrier and P one in which little research has been done into the application on-board vessels as part of the maritime energy transition. The key beneﬁts of iron powder are that it is a circular energy carrier and the combustion process emits no greenhouse gases. Transitioning to iron powder is expected to have far reaching implications for the design and performance of ships. Thus, this paper aims to perform the ﬁrst study assessing the potential of this concept applied to container ships. To do so, a preliminary design space D was explored with a custom parametric design model developed to generate preliminary designs of iron fuelled container ships as a function of the operational proﬁle. Using this parametric design model, it was identiﬁed that iron fuelled container ships are weight limited, unlike conventionally fuelled container E vessels. Furthermore, iron fuelled container ships are best suited for short voyages at low cruising speed. For these voyages, it was concluded that iron fuelled ships are economically feasible; however, other alT ternative marine fuels are likely more proﬁtable than iron due to the low efﬁciency of iron fuelled ships and the high cost of iron per unit energy.},

There is thus a desire to R develop additional, more accurate trim tables without the need for expensive model testing. The objective of this research was to develop a method to decrease fuel consumption by trim optimization, by a dynamic P shaft power estimation model based on available operational data. A method that uses noon report data and a grey-box modelling approach is proposed. The grey box model consists of a multi-layer feedforward neural network to estimate the required shaft power, using operational parameters and an initial estimate of the required shaft power. A case study is presented for a modern chemical tanker and sea trials have been conducted to validate the results. The method provides correct trim advice for full load conditions; D however, the magnitude of the effect is smaller compared to sea trial results. The model is able to estimate the required power with an average accuracy of over 6\% for a random subset of the noon report data. Due E to challenges inherent to noon reports as a data source, the actual effect of trim and speed have a bigger magnitude than the extracted trend.},

This reduction can be conducted by either using a compliant fuel with lower sulfur content, an alternative fuel (e.g. LNG, methanol), or clean its exhaust gasses with a "scrubber" technology to reduce the output of CO2 , NOx and SOx emissions. The objective of this paper is to present a holistic approach to continuously monitor and estimate the emissions of a vessel as well as to assess and improve the efficiency of scrubbers. Furthermore the deployment of a cutting-edge, integrated framework, incorporating the latest technological advances, that can of er the ability to capture, process and analyze vessels’ operational data in order to improve efficiency, sustainability, and rule compliance is presented. Particularly the conceptualization and materialization of a big data application suite that exploits the IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) advancements and technologies, to employ a “digital replica” of the en-route vessel is demonstrated. By collecting a multitude of features from on-board sensor installments, we present how we can effectively utilize these features, harvested in real time, in order to accurately assess and estimate the environmental footprint of the vessel by employing robust Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) predictors. Then we describe in detail the streamlined procedure from data acquisition to model deployment, utilizing the proposed big data framework, in order to assess and estimate the emissions during the operational state of the vessel. Finally, we demonstrate experimental results by deploying comparative analysis utilizing operational data from one containership-centric Living Lab (LL) in order to validate and confirm our approaches in terms of accuracy and performance in a real world setting.},

To solve this problem, this paper carried out the research of ship strength digital twin. Concretely, to meet the real-time requirements for obtaining the structural stress state, this paper proposed a rapid acquisition method for structural strength evaluation stresses of the ship digital twin model, which realizes the rapid acquisition for structural yield strength evaluation stresses at the monitoring point and the non-monitoring point. To illustrate the specific application and application effect of the proposed method, the amidships three compartments section of a 21,000TEU ultra-large container ship was selected as the research object. And the case that this research object may suffer from the vertical wave bending moment and the horizontal wave bending moment simultaneously was considered. Related studies show that the proposed method can accurately recognize the load actually suffered by the ship monitoring structure. And the specific meaning of the ship monitoring structure referred to here is the ship hull structure that requires structural stress state monitoring. At the same time, related studies also show that the maximum error of the calculation results obtained by the proposed method does not exceed 0.0005\% in obtaining the structural yield strength evaluation stress at the monitoring point, while the maximum calculation error does not exceed 0.032\% in obtaining the structural yield strength evaluation stress at the nonmonitoring point.},

	abstract = {The focus on digitalisation in manufacturing is spreading to other industry fields, including large and complex objects like ships. Such interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships.},

The hydrodynamic and elastic problems are solved simultaneously which leads to fast convergence rates. The free boundary problem at the contact’s exit is handled by a penalty method. For highly loaded contacts, the standard Galerkin solution of Reynolds equation exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. The use of artiﬁcial diffusion techniques is proposed to stabilize the solution. This approach is then extended to account for non-Newtonian lubricant behaviour and thermal effects. Artiﬁcial diffusion procedures are also introduced to stabilize the solution at high loads.},

The results demonstrate that the new bearing has better static and dynamic performances compared with those of traditional bearing in which orifices are equal in diameter and distribute evenly. Moreover, thin gas film thickness, high supply pressure, and large eccentricity ratio are hopeful for improving load capacity of the new bearing.

	title = {A generalized {Reynolds} equation for fluid-film lubrication},
	abstract = {In tho analysis of fluid-film bearings the basic equation employed is known as tho Reynolds equation. This equation, which governs the generation of pressure in the lubricant film, is encountered in numerous forms each applicable to a particular set of circumstances only. The study of fluid-film lubrication suffers from this multiplicity of Reynolds-type equations, and the influence of different physical mechanisms associated with pressure generation is frequently masked by the difference in form of the initial equations. In recent years a further mechanism of pressure generation associated with the variation of fluid properties across the film has been suggested, and this has resulted in new forms of the pressure equation. In this paper a generalized form of Reynolds equation is developed which permits the variation of relevant quantities across, as well as along, the lubricant film. This equation is derived from the fundamental equations of hydrodynamics with a minimum of restrictive assumptions, and it will be seen that it can be reduced to any of the forms currently employed in the analysis of fluid-film bearings.},

	abstract = {All structures exhibit some form of damping, but the characterization of damping is not wellunderstood, and there is no universal damping model for the dynamic systems. Recently, model updating methods have been used to update or identify the damping matrix in dynamic systems. Most of the finite element updating methods assume viscous and proportional damping models for updating or identifying of damping matrix. In this paper, a new finite element model updating method is proposed in which the damping model is assumed as non-viscous and nonproportional. A parametric exponential non-viscous damping model has been used to model the damping in the dynamic system. The proposed method is the frequency response function (FRF)-based updating model, which updates the non-viscous and non-proportional damping matrix in the dynamic system. The effectiveness of the proposed damped finite element updating method is demonstrated by a numerical example and actual laboratory experiments. First, a numerical study is performed on a cantilever beam structure with non-viscous and nonproportional damping. The numerical study is followed by cases involving actual measured data. Joints and boundary conditions are assumed as a major source of damping, therefore joints and boundary conditions are modelled using relaxation functions and damping coefficients. The updated results have shown that the proposed damped element model updating method can be used to derive accurate models for the non-viscous and non-proportional damped systems. This is illustrated by matching complex FRFs obtained from the updated model with from the experi­ mental data.},

A major limitation of the mass and stiﬀness proportional damping approximation is the lack of generality of the model to allow for experimentally observed variation of damping factors with respect to vibration frequency in complex structures. To remedy this, a new generalized proportional damping model is proposed. The proposed method requires only the measurements of natural frequencies and modal damping factors which can be obtained using a point measurement of the frequency response function (FRF). Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method. Veriﬁcation of the proposed technique in lab scale experiments is presented.

	abstract = {Direct numerical integration of the differential equations of motion is widely used to analyse a structure behaviour under the action of seismic loads. Whatever the reason is, an engineer is faced with a problem of calculating Rayleigh damping coefficients. In the direct method, a damping matrix is formed by a linear combination of the mass and stiffness matrices multiplied by Rayleigh coefficients  and  respectively. To calculate the damping coefficients  and , an engineer need two circular frequencies (1, 2) defining the frequency range which contribute to the response of the structure and a damping ratio (). As far as one knows, Rayleigh damping coefficients have significant impact on the structure response to seismic loads therefore the design values of the damping coefficients should be justified. When the modal superposition method is used, the engineer is able to account accurately for damping, because one can use a material-damping ratio (fraction of critical damping). In this paper, the authors carry out time-history analyses of a fixed base building subjected to seismic loads by the modal superposition and direct integration methods. In the direct method, damping properties of the building are taken into account with Rayleigh damping coefficients calculated on different approaches. The building response to seismic loads are compared by the response spectra calculated upon the timehistories retrieved from the modal superposition and direct methods. The least conservative approach of calculating damping coefficients is proposed for the time-history analysis with Rayleigh damping.},

	abstract = {In this study, we propose effective formulations for modal, frequency response, and transient analyses using condensed matrices of the ﬁnite element (FE) model. Employing the iterated improved reduced system (IIRS) method, a transformation matrix is deﬁned that condenses the stiffness and inertial effects of nodes to be neglected into nodes of interest. Using this, the condensed mass and stiffness matrices are derived. With these two condensed matrices, a condensed damping matrix is derived using the Rayleigh damping. By considering the condensed matrices in the original structural dynamic formulation based on the global FE matrices, the condensed structural dynamic formulation is derived, and the approximated solutions are calculated from this condensed formulation. To verify the performance of the proposed formulation, we perform a structural dynamic analysis on a stiffened plate, and by comparison with the solutions calculated from the global FE matrices, the proposed formulations have been found to provide highly accurate solutions with an excellent computational efﬁciency.},

In the current work, a model for flexible rotor supported on two symmetric journal bearings is investigated. The nonlinear bearing forces are evaluated by either using direct solution of Reynolds equation or analyzing Reynolds equation to obtain linear and nonlinear bearing stiffness and damping coefficients using time dependent second order perturbation method. These coefficients are obtained for different operating conditions and bearing parameters such as length to diameter ratio, groove angle or applied groove pressure. The present results are validated with the previous literature and a perturbation analysis is used to investigate the validity range of the bearing linear and nonlinear coefficients. A novel technique based on polynomial fitting is used to present the bearing coefficient as a function of the bearing parameters. This enables the investigation of the dynamics of flexible rotor model using numerical continuation technique. Also, the effect of the bearing design parameters such as groove angle, length to diameter ratio and static pressure on the system stability is investigated.},

This behavior prevents the theoretical determination of bearing stiffness and damping coefficients with an adequate accuracy and makes damage detection difficult. Considering that dynamic coefficients have similar sensitivity to damage and considering that it is easier to monitor bearing stiffness than bearing damping, this article discusses a method to estimate experimentally the effective stiffness coefficients of hydrogenerators journal bearings, using only the usually monitored vibrations, with damage detection purposes. Validated using vibration signals synthesized by a simplified mathematical model that simulates the dynamic behavior of large hydrogenerators, the method was applied to a journal bearing of a 700 MW hydrogenerator, using two different excitations, the generator rotor unbalance and the vortices formed in the turbine rotor when this machine operates at partial loads. The experimental bearing stiffnesses obtained using both excitations were similar, but they were also much lower than the theoretical predictions. The article briefly discusses the causes of these discrepancies, the method’s uncertainties, and the possible improvements in its application.},

The CFD commercial software FLUENT is mainly used in this simulation, which employs a finite volume method for the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. To determine the dynamic coefficients, a new mesh movement approach is presented to update the volume mesh when the journal moves during the 3D transient flow calculation of a journal bearing. Existing dynamic mesh models provided by FLUENT are not suitable for the transient oil flow in journal bearings. Measurements and identification are performed on a test rotor supported on a pair of identical two-lobe fluid film bearings, and the results obtained from the CFD methods agree well with experimental results.

The shaft finite element model is based on the Timoshenko beam theory, which includes the elastic contribution from the shear effects and the inertial contribution from the rotary inertia and gyroscopic moments. Moreover, a finite element procedure for solution of the classical Reynolds equation for incompressible fluid films, in conjunction with a linearized perturbation procedure, is implemented to allow the computation of the dynamic force-coefficients of cylindrical journal bearings. The finite element equations of motion for an unbalanced rotor supported on fluid film bearings are integrated by using the Newmark method. The procedure permits the determination of the the time-domain and frequency-domain unbalance response of rotor-bearing systems at different journal loads and eccentricities. Numerical results depict some curves of whirl amplitude versus frequency and some plots of the whirl orbit for a rotor composed of a flexible shaft and an unbalanced rigid disk supported on two hydrodynamic journal bearings. The effects of the cross-coupled bearing stiffness and damping on the rotor unbalanced response are analyzed by using the computational procedure implemented in this work.},

	abstract = {Calculation of torsional vibrations is essential in the early phase of the design of any ship propulsion system, after selection of shafting diameters in accordance with the Classification Rules. Later on, during ship trials, the calculation shall be validated by measurements on board. The calculation results depend upon inertial moments of actual masses, stiffness of shafting components, damping in the actual shafting components, as well as the excitation forces and moments exerted by the propulsion engine(s) and the propeller. Inertial moments and stiffness can be determined with no ambiguities. However, this is not the case with either the damping, or the engine excitation. Actually, during validation on board the calculation supposed damping is the main influential factor to be verified. The aim of this paper is to present and compare several models to define and compare damping definitions in the the torsional vibrations calculation (Frahm's model, Archer's model, physical damping, magnification factor, etc.) in a systematic way, to enable designers to correctly apply the selected damping model. Further on the engine excitation may be expressed by means of cylinder pressures or tangential forces to the cranks. The essentials of the two models and the procedure to convert one excitation model into another one are also presented. The application of the presented damping and excitation models is presented on an actual ship propulsion system and conclusions drawn.},

Using the method of separation of variables in an additive and a multiplicative form, a set of particular solutions of the Reynolds equation is added in the general solution of the homogenous Reynolds equation thus a closed form expression for the deﬁnition of the lubricant pressure is presented. The Reynolds equation is split into four linear ordinary differential equations of second order with non-constant coefﬁcients and together with the boundary conditions they form four Sturm–Liouville problems with the three of them to have direct forms of solution and one of them to be confronted using the method of power series. The mathematical procedure is presented up to the point that the application of the boundaries for the pressure distribution yields the ﬁnal deﬁnition of the solution with the calculation of the constants. The current work gives in detail the mathematical path with the help of which the analytical solution is derived, and ends with the pressure evaluation and a comparison with past numerical solutions and an approximate analytical solution for a ﬁnite bearing.

	abstract = {In this thesis, a full-system finite element approach to elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication problems is introduced. EHD lubrication is a full-film regime where the pressure generated in the conjunction is high enough to induce a significant elastic deformation of the contacting bodies. Hence, it involves a strong coupling between hydrodynamic and elastic effects. The non-linear system formed by the Reynolds’, linear elasticity and load balance equations is solved using a fully-coupled Newton-Raphson procedure. This approach provides outstanding convergence rates when compared with the semi-system one. A penalty method is used to handle the cavitation problem that arises at the outlet of the contact. Appropriate stabilized formulations are used to extend the solution to the case of highly loaded contacts. The resolution process is then extended to account for non-Newtonian behaviour of the lubricant and for thermal effects. The developed model is used to study the behaviour of EHD contacts lubricated with Ultra-Low-Viscosity Fluids. The use of such fluids as lubricants provides two main advantages: first, the frictional energy dissipation in the contact is reduced and second, in machines that work with a low viscosity operational fluid and a lubricant, the former can be used to fulfil both functions and thus the design and maintenance of such machines would become easier and their performance would be improved.},

In the existing literature, several numerical analyses had been reported. Most of these analyses used two dimensional Reynolds equations to find the pressure distribution in the lubricant flow by neglecting the pressure variation across the film thickness. Besides that, most researchers only consider laminar flow. In this paper, three turbulent models which are the Standard k-İ model, Realizable k-İ model and Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) had been used to simulate the characteristics of a plain journal bearing. Three dimensional models had been simulated using ANSYS Fluent software package to accurately predict the performance of the three turbulent models on the journal bearing analysis. Design parameter like static pressure, wall shear stress and dimensionless load carrying capacity were considered and transient analysis was carried out for the analysis with different L/D ratio of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. The results showed that for the cases of thin film lubricated journal bearing, the turbulent models did not give any significant to the simulation results.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the linear natural vibrations analysis of beams where the geometric and material properties vary periodically along the beam axis. In contrast with homogeneous prismatic beams, the frequency spectra of such beams are irregular as there exist enlarged intervals between some adjacent frequencies. Presented here are two averaged models of beams based on the tolerance modelling approach. The assumptions of classical Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theories are adopted as the foundations. The resulting mathematical models are systems of differential equations with constant, weight-averaged coefﬁcients. This makes it possible to apply any classical method of solution suitable for homogeneous beams, such as Galerkin orthogonalization. Here, emphasis is placed on the comparison of natural frequencies neighbouring the frequency band-gaps that are obtained from these two theories. Two basic cases of material and geometric property distribution in a periodicity cell are studied, and the natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained for a simply supported beam. The results are supported by a comparison with the ﬁnite element method and partially exact solutions.},

A hull simulation model is established to calculate hull deformations corresponding to the reaction force of stern bearings under multi-factor and multi-operating conditions. The results show that in the condition of wave load, hull deformation shows randomness; the aft stern tube bearing load obeys the Gaussian distribution and its value increases signiﬁcantly compared with the load under static, and the probability of aft stern tube bearing load greater than 1 is 65.7\%. The inﬂuence laws and levels between hull deformation and bearing reaction force are revealed, and suggestions for ship stern bearing speciﬁcations are proffered accordingly.},

In particular it applies to low order ﬁnite elements with equal interpolation order for both displacement and pressure ﬁelds. The approach successfully eliminates the eﬀect of volumetric locking for elastic nearly incompressible media and the elasto-plastic media exhibiting incompressible or dilatant plastic ﬂow. The performance of the proposed formulation is compared with the stabilized formulation based on pressure Laplacian. It is shown that the proposed stabilized formulation also supports mixing diﬀerent elements.},
